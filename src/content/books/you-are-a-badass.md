The excellent thing about living as a human being on planet Earth is that you have the almighty power of choice, which means you get to choose between achieving success and giving up.

The excellent thing about success is that it always comes down to one simple thing: the decision to keep going until you've reached your goal.

I recommend keeping your workout short so you don't get overwhelmed, ideally fifteen to thirty minutes per day, first thing in the morning.

If you’re kinda _sorta_ serious about changing your life, you’ll find an excuse.

Please do not waste your one and only chance to be the you that is you on planet Earth screwing around with excuses when you have the power to create whatever you desire.

The next time you’re feeling lazy or like you’ve got too much going on to do X, remember that all the tiny bits matter in a very large way.

This moment is a vital part of a whole life that I’m creating. What I choose to do in this moment defines who I am and how I show up in the world. I’m dedicated to creating an extremely awesome life for myself, so I’m taking this moment seriously, getting the hell on it, and staying in excited expectation of the stupendousness hurtling toward me.

For example, next time you’re tempted to smoke a cigarette, keep in mind that not only will the craving only last a couple of moments, but so will the satisfaction you get from smoking that cigarette.

Train your focus on something else for a handful of seconds, like the image of your pink, healthy lungs giving you a standing ovation, and before you know it the craving will pass.

Staying disciplined is simply a matter of waiting and refocusing,

When upset by a person or a situation, remember that your reactions are not the truth about the person or situation, they are just your feelings about them. All you have to do is change your perception and you are free.

If you want to live an enjoyable life, be diligent about what you pay attention to.

All worrying will do is make you live through the misery twice.

Befriend the unfamiliar, the risky, the me no wanna. The discomfort means you’re almost there.

Giving people the benefit of the doubt is excellent practice for not taking stuff personally, and it gives you room to focus on more beneficial aspects of your life than on how pissed off you are.

When you first wake up, please, oh, please don’t get sucked into your phone or computer or your to- do list. Stay in that juicy space of in- betweenness, be still for even just ten minutes, and bask in the awareness that you are a multidimensional, spiritual creature capable of transcending the limitations of your conscious mind.

The moment you realize the not so great behavior is rearing its head, you can interrupt it by saying something like, “Here I go, it’s happening right now.” Then step back to watch yourself and make a more impressive choice about how to respond.

True power comes from thinking what you want to think, regardless of how things appear or what other people say or how impossible your ideas may seem.

When we reach our goals, eventually they become our new normal.

Make the conscious effort to stay present and do your best with every single endeavor you undertake today.

If you’re washing the dishes, notice the sound of the water, feel the squish of the sponge, and pay close attention to getting every little bit clean.

Come up with an image that represents your personal sanctuary.

Motivation, commitment, focus— these are all muscles that, like any muscle, require strengthening.

Your job is to shift any negative beliefs that are holding you back; align your thoughts and energy with that of your new “reality” and take decisive, fearless action so the physical manifestation of your desires can come running into your lovin’ arms.

I am whole, I am complete, everything I desire is already here.

Every time you come from a place of “I need to get X” today, flip that impulse around and make it about giving.

For example, if you realize you’re out of toothpaste, instead of focusing on getting some, focus on giving the drugstore your business; on giving the employees a smile and a hearty “Thank ye mucho!”; on giving thanks that you have the money,

Treat everything in your world like it’s brand-new get out of your rut, take a different route to work, wear a hat if you never wear one, speak to strangers

Every time you catch yourself about to launch into a disgruntlement, pause, breathe, and look for the lesson in the situation instead, or find something to be grateful for in what you’re currently perceiving as nastiness.

Wake up in the morning and declare what it is that you’ll celebrate today.

“This is your one and only life we’re talking about here. Stay the course.”

Make sure every single decision you make today is in alignment with your goal.

Overwhelm exists in the future. Staying present while thoughtfully answering each email

The more often you use your downtime to meditate and go inward and connect as opposed to distract yourself and go outward and get sucked into the virtual world, the more peaceful and happy you’ll be.

Visualize whatever new situation you are excited and totally not screwing around about creating for yourself. See it, feel it, own it, be it, shout it from the mountaintop, keep this energy strong. Then do something that will advance you toward this new reality that scares the holy heck out of you or that makes you extremely uncomfortable or that pushes you beyond what you once pretended your limits were.
