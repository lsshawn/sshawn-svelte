# I Code

I love learning new stuff to make stuff, and coding is the tool.

I'm a **full-stack developer** and run a remote web development agency.

My clients hire me because I can help them **launch MVP fast**.

My programming languages: Typescript, Javascript, Vue.js, React.js, Node.js, Python, R, MongoDB, GraphQL, AWS Serverless, Rust.

Right now I'm focused on **Web3 and DeFi**.

Would love to contribute to decentralization. [Let's talk.](/contact)

# I'm a Polygot

I speak 5 languages: English, Malay, Korean, Chinese, and Cantonese.

New language put me out of my comfort zone and remind me to be brave at making mistakes.

The reward is I get to open the heart of other people.

# I'm a Quant

Did my Master degree in Financial Engineering and worked 3 years as a quantitative researcher.

I specialized in:

- analyzing portfolio risk
- evaluating investments
- programming portfolio monitoring tools
- code and backtest trading strategies.

Why did I left my finance job to work on tech? Because it's hard to beat HODL.

Now with Web3 and DeFi, I can leverage my quant and coding skills to contribute to decentralization.

# I'm a Minimalist

I follow [r/BuyItForLife](https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/), [r/OneBag](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/), and [r/Vim](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/).

I don't buy presents on friend's birthday. I give out crypto wallets.

Minimalism rewires my brain to always think "What I don't need". I guess that's why I'm good at coding MVP.
