Many people got famous on being on the right side of their prediction.

The election result - even though it's a coin flip probability.

Is the economy bad next year - unless there's an alien invasion, economy doesn't turn when you wake up tomorrow. So most of the time, you could sense it.

Some fund managers made their name by making correct predictions.

Some top earners answer "I don't know what will happen."

## What will you do

I rather hear 2 things:

- What you'll do when it goes right
- What you'll do when it starts to turn bad.

I don't care if your prediction made you millions.

Keep your prediction about the election to yourself.

50% of the world population are guessing correctly.

Nothing glamorous about it.
