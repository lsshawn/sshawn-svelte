Durians have thorns to ward off animals from eating them. Thousand of years ago, durians could have been as smooth as tomato.

If we continue to eat a lot of tomatoes, could tomatoes evolve to have thorns?

Or soybeans becoming poisonous to defend against us.

Sounds silly, but nature always continue to evolve.

It'll take centuries, but your potato is now scheming to sacrifice its neighbour, yam, to become your fries.

Your puppy might even learn the concept of pet and have a pet ant.

What about you? Are you evolving to survive in this world? Or have you given up?
