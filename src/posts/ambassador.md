# Ambassador beat referral and influencers

Ambassadors are micro micro influencers.

They are proud and loyal customers.

They are your long-tail.

# Rewards

Stay away from typical "share with your friends and receive $x off". Do:

- Pay them in product, gifts, and merchandise.
- Give them 10% of whatever they sell after meeting a base $1k.
- Host meeting to acknowledge performers and provide tips.
