1. 101: Focus on a buzzword and explain.
2. Big story from the past.
3. What is X and how it can change your life.
4. Contrary to what you've heard

# Threads

Threads are the best to grow your followers.

1. First tweet is the most important.

- Open with a brief 3-5 word declaration that shows your expertise.
- Replace adjectives with specific numbers to make your point clearly.
- Reference popular names/brands that people care about.

```
Referal program works.

Paypal used one to acquire 100m users

Here are 6 referral programmes you should steal:
```

2. Use emotions

> Airbnb: Our secret's finally out

3. In-app tweet is favoured by Twitter algorithm.

So don't use TweetDeck or Typefully.

4. CTA in 2nd last tweet

```
Would this help you?

- [list of what readers and get from following you]

If so, follow @your_handle :)

Because I'm writing ___ for 20 days straight [set expectations]
```

End with a bonus 'TL;DR' tweet.

Don't end with CTA because Twitter condense the thread to show first and last.

Seeing a CTA in the last thread appears spammy.
