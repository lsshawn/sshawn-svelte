- Always think of the entry point. Where do you want visitors to see first?
- Too much empty space could make it less credible.

## Hero

- Add a down arrow below hero to show there's more content below.
- Add small roundness to sharp corner
- Use images that break out of rectangle to catch attention.
- Make it pretty
- Image and headline must match. E.g. for a mover company, use a photo of family watching the movers.

## Menu

- More menu dilutes attention. Keep to 3.
- Are users browsing or searching for something? Match menu names to what they are searching for.
  - 'topics' is better than 'learn' because users are searching for topics.

## Layout

- Match visitors' expectations on arrival
- Use skeleton loaders like Youtube.

## Post

- Floating download button:
  - Put on bottom right
  - Use subtle animation. Too persuasive animations will turn off people.
- Add white card background if you want people to read through.

## Page

- Don't use section header with a background because it feels they are 2 separate item.
- Grid is good for browsing. List is for finding. Amazon is a good example.

## Countdown timer

- Don't use countdown timer if it's more than 24 hours because there are more than 3 things changing.
- Use red color to make the time seem closer.

## Social proof

- Doesn't create desire
- More vertical images to appear larger.
- Social similarity is persuasive. Use specific words like '10k of guests who stayed in this room recycled their towels'

## Image

- Skew image inward to face text to keep readers' focus
- Shoot image from bottom to feel like you're looking upward. It gives more trust â€“ like a baby looking up to new mom.
- Show a hand holding the book.
- Images choices:
  - emphasize benefits early in decision (person playing guitar to make friends happy)
  - emphasize features late in decision (person learning guitar 1-on-1)

## Color

- White background if:
  - action oriented (sign ups)
  - non-profit
  - proud to showcase to the world
- Dark background if:
  - enjoyment (Netflix)
  - emotional
  - something to hide (porn, beginner in Photoshop)
- For dark background sections, don't use white or striking color for border color.
- Avoid non-clickable blue text.
- Black background with white pricing gives more value.

## Logo

- Use text based for small businesses.
- E.g. 'psychology + marketing'. The lowercase shows casualness. The plus symbol appears more scientific than &.

## Button

- For pages before checkout, use 'Choose' instead of 'Buy'.
- Price seem smaller if they are smaller than the buy button.
- Make it more clickable:

  - use words that people use in real life. No cutesy words like 'Count me in'.
  - no exclamation mark.
  - 'Yes, add it' is better than 'Yes, I'll buy it'. 'Buy' makes user feel they he is losing something. 'Add' makes user feel he is gaining something.
  - Add a white card behind button so it appears closer to user.
  - Add a finger icon on the right so user can image themselves tapping on it.
  - Put buttons at the bottom of the screen

- For rejection button:

  - don't use 'No thanks'. It's too clickable because it's polite and natural.
  - use unnatural words, e.g. later, delay to later
  - don't insult like 'No I don't want free stuff'
  - 'No' is not ideal because user might make up on justification to reject the offer even if they see it in the future.

- Transparent button:

  - Only in white background
  - More suitable for mobile phone
  - Less noticable, so make sure you already have user's attention.

- Large button inflates the perception of price.

- Square button for rational decision, precise goals e.g. download.
- Round button for emotional decision, broad goals, e.g. subscribe

- Sections with rounded dividers will make buttons less clickable because it seems less stable.

- Sticky buttons at the bottom is good because people are more willing to buy something they see more often.

## Pricing page

- Background highlight the most expensive to anchor users' decision.
- For vertical pricing, sort most expensive to least expensive.
- For horizontal, arrange from least expensive to most expensive. User expect numbers to grow larger to the right.
- Sales pricing:
  - Original price on the left. Discounted on right and smaller.
  - Add more distance between them.
  - Use rounded original price to make it seem larger
  - Red discounted prices are more attractive to men.
  - To make the price difference bigger:
    - Change from round to precise number (~40,000.00~ 15,999.00)
    - Change from decimal to round (~5.4~ 3)
- Sold out: Make the sold out banner or cross larger to give illusion of limited options.
- [Divergent processing] Have more space between discounted price and original price to create perception of bigger discount, e.g. 3000 --------------------> 69.
- [Convergent processing] Don't show discounted price below a slashed original price. User will perceive the discounted price is expensive because it's viewed together with the original price.
- Don't show '$69 (You save $2900)'. Instead use '$69 (Yep...it's not a typo)'. Use self-generated inferences words. Words that user are likely to say silently. You're also not biased to yourselves. User is the source of the statement.

## Checkout

- Reduce options and menu. Don't dilute their focus.
- Progress bar:
  - Don't use a long horizontal line. They make the process appear long.
  - Use color and animation to show user progress between the steps.
  - Move the 2nd last step indicator closer to the final step. Because you're so close to checkout, you're more likely to complete it.

## Bottom page CTA

[Subscribe <to what>]
Get <what> each month.
Join 30k subscribers (small social proof)

## Upsell

- If an upsell is not enticing, bundle it as a mystery gift. Give a hint like 'this may pay for the entire course'
- Use a heading title that keeps the flow, e.g. 'Wait, there's more...'

## Footer

If you have a bottom CTA in the middle, keep the middle of Footer clear. You don't want to distract from the CTA.
