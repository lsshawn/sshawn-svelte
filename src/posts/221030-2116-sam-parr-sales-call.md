## Get them to tell if they have the problem you're solving

Have you tried \_\_\_ app?

Why haven't you?

Tell me about that.

## Close without asking to buy

This product, if you use it, how much will it help you? How much revenue/time-saving you'll get.

I'm offering this, I'm solving this problem. I have a product already. In the future, I'm going to charge X but right how, you're early, so I'm going to charge Y.

If I can make all this happen, are you in? Do you want to try it out?

Btw, I'll refund your money entirely if you're not interested later.
