# Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule"

Source: http://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html

There are two types of schedule, which I'll call the manager's schedule and the maker's schedule.

Most powerful people are on the manager's schedule. It's the schedule of command.

When you're on the maker's schedule, meetings are a disaster. It changes the mode you're working.

Problems arise when they meet.

The solution? Office hours.
