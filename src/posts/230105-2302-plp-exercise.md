If you want to put on muscle but are short on time, try the 60-day PLP Challenge.

PLP stands for Pull-ups, Lunges, Pushups. On Day 1, you do 10 reps of each, on Day 2, you do 11 reps of each, on Day 3, you do 12 reps of each, and so on, all the way up to 69 reps. The slow, steady accumulation of volume creates impressive progress (I've gotten leaner and more dense from doing it in the past). Make sure to take care of your soft tissue quality if you do the challengeâ€”use a foam roller and massage your shoulders and lats to avoid injury. You can also add PLP to your normal workouts to layer in a challenging, growth-driving element.
