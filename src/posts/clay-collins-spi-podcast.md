## The Ladder

### 1. Minimum Viable Customer

3-6 months
22
2000 email subscribers.

Each blog post is a chance for a new idea.

Test: Will you be comfortable telling your grandma about what you do?

Offer consulting (hourly).

Focus on messaging and getting people to subscribe.

### 2. Focus on getting 6 figures ARR

Goal: 6 figures in 1 year
The rule of 5/1. Get super deep. Limit yourself to:
1 product
1 conversion mechanism
1 traffic source
1 year to test
1 year to achieve $1mn

Focus on providing value.

5 commandment:

- only have 1 business
- Only 1 offer
- After launch, spend only 1 day per month on product creation. You need to focus on selling
- Don't spend more than 1 day on content marketing (unless it's your primary source)
- Find beauty in depth rather than width

Steps:

- Create a product
- Create an offer (guarantee, payment plan, pricing)
- Conversion process (landing page, eg)
- Get traffic

### 3

Goal: 7 figures

- Upsell: something 5-10x more expensive
- Automation
- Conversion and traffic test
