## Questions to ponder

How to setup trust in Malaysia?

If Malaysia company pay dividend to a holding company overseas, is the dividend taxed in Malaysia?

Does paying dividend reduces the amount of corporate tax payable in Malaysia?

I seen a lot of holding company is setup in Labuan or other BVI countries. Why? Is it because there's no corporate tax? And if I hold on to a holding company in Malaysia, I need to pay corporate tax every year?

## Here's the biggest advantage of a PHC:

Profits from any of the businesses can be distributed to the HoldCo as a dividend, which are usually tax-free. You can then re-invest this cash into any of the other businesses within the PHC, or to even start or buy another a new company.

## Structuring Your Personal Holding Company (PHC)

1. Trust — Entrepreneur is the trustee that owns nothing but controls everything below. Trust allows for estate planning, liability protection and income/capital gains splitting. Not required but recommended.

2. HoldCo — Owned by the Trust. Can either be LLC taxed as S-Corp or S-Corp, if you want to withdraw cash. Or, C-Corp for long-term growth to take advantage of QSBS. Keep in mind that the HoldCo doesn't sell any products or services. It just "holds" controlling stock in other companies.

3. Businesses — Falls underneath the HoldCo. These can be LLCs, Series LLCs, or Corporations, depending on the business. Can range from tech startups to real estate, and everything in between.
