# Getting started is the hardest part

Just start.

Get all your bank balances and enter.

Don't worry about the past.

Now start tracking all expenses.

On budgeting, if you always find yourself cash strap at the end of month, you should create a budget. I skip budgeting for every category of my life because I know I'm frugal and have more than 20% of income as savings.

On expense tracking, it's okay to not track everything. Here are some rules I set for myself:

- If it's food or small leisure activity with cash, I don't track it. I count the cash in my wallet at the end of the week and create a 'cash distribution'. Maybe 80% food, 20% leisure

```
2014-06-19 * "Cash distribution"
  Expenses:Food:Restaurant           402.30 USD
  Expenses:Leisure:Snooker              100.00 USD
  Assets:Cash                     ; -502.30 USD

2014-06-20 balance Assets:Cash       194.34 USD
```
