# Common site features that kill conversions

- Pop-up
- Generic CTA like 'Shop now'
- Site wide discount. You can build better brand loyalty with:
  - referral programs
  - loyalty programs
  - free gifts with purchase
  - reduced shipping
- Selling features and not benefits
- FAQ page is rarely visited. Insert small text to pro-actively answer customers' FAQ.

## Optimization Pyramid (from highest reach to lowest)

1. Trust and security

Use less generic design.

Don't use design that's breaking away from convention.

Add proof-in-numbers like charity:water.

2. Pain-free UX

3. Content

Show when you can, tell when you can’t.

One of the last questions we ask website users before the checkout overview is ‘What questions do you still have that you need answered in order to make a purchase?'

Look at [stumptowncoffee.com](stumptowncoffee.com) for example of step-by-step contents.

4. Guided path

Find out how users intend to use your site and create curated collections for them.

5. Incentive to checkout

6. Untapped motivations

What are your customers trying to do with their lives? Becoming a great mom?
