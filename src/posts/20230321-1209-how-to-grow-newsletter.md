# Milk Road case study

80% of traffic from paid advertising (Facebook and TikTok):

- FB leads campaign by measuring how likely a person will fill up a form.
- Broad audience of aged 21-45. Let FB algorithm work it out.
- Target audience of crypto-related celebrity and business.

Start with a simple landing page that asks for email.

## Ads Creative

Four types of ad creative Matt says kicked ass:

1. Memes

Use a template with your own words: https://imgflip.com/memetemplates

Bonus if you can include social proof.

2. TikTok/UGC style videos.

Paid $80-$100 per video for micro-influencers and Upwork. 30 seconds vertical video.

A great video contains:

- Have a hook in the first five seconds
- Show how the newsletter solves a specific problem the reader has
- Show social proof
- Strong call to action
- If the newsletter is free, say that

3. Informal Banners

Create something that doesnâ€™t look like a typical ad.

E.g. Use your phone to write a note an screenshot. Write on legal pad.

4. Testimonials

Ask readers to tweet about the newsletters. Screenshot it and use as ads.

## Budget

$30 a day during the 'learning phase'. Budge $4 per conversion. Keep to this budget until you get 50 conversions per week.
