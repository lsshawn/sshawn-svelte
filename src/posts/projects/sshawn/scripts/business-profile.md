Here are projects that I've worked on.

For apps, I prefer to build web-apps instead of app for Android and iOS. Reason is, you get 3 times costs saving while having your app working properly on all devices. And you get functionalities like camera, location, and notifications.

Web apps:
Chatbot automation: https://cupbots.com
Shopee analytic: https://shoperware.com
Custom chatbot for HR consulting: https://app.third-idea.com

Other small web apps:

We also write scripts to help automate manual processes in companies. For example:

- daily download and upload of CSV files.
- printing Shopee packing list onto waybills.
- connecting softwares within a company to reduce manual updates.
