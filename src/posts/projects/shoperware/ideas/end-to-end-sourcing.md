# Hook

Imagine this...

Every day, you get a list of top selling items in a category in Taobao.

Next to each product, you see a score from 1 to 10 of how well it'll sell in Shopee Malaysia.

And also the product profit margin after freight charges.

All calculated automatically for you.

Now you just have to pick products you like...

click the "ORDER" button...

then Shoperware will create a Shopee bulk import format file with all Taobao pictures and arrange your China fulfillment centre.

# Proceess

Find top selling items in Taobao with not many sellers in Malaysia yet:

1. See top selling products in a category in 1688 or taobao.
2. Identify products you find interesting. Then check Shopee for demand and competitiveness using Shoperware Product Research.
3. Check freight charges.
4. If enough profit margin, arrange fulfillment centre.
5. Convert the Taobao listing into Shopee bulk import format.
