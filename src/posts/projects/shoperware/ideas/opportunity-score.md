---

A score of 1 to 10 based on demand and competition.

# Competition

- 90% of the top 20 selling listing have 50-100 reviews
- top 20 sellers have less than 500 reviews on average
- less than 3 sellers with less than 50 reviews
- no one brand taking 75% of the sales
- selling price around 18 to 50

# Demand

- monthly sales of top 20 products: 10k to 30k
- monthly units sold of top 20 products: 2000 units

Possible to use subcategory normal distribution.

Then we'll assign a score based on quartile.

Or we can break it down to price range and get normal distributions for each price range.

# Profitability

Heavier weight because a good niche means nothing if it's no profitable.
