title: "The probability of selling this product is..."
---

How can you prevent wasting thousands sourcing a product that's hard to sell in Shopee?

Wouldn't it be nice to have a probability number to show how likely a product can sell?

Then you'll want to use our new **Opportunity Score** in Product Research.

## What does the score mean?

Opportunity Score gives a score between 0 to 100 for the keyword you search. Here's you can use the score:

### 10 or below

This is a sign that no one is searching and buying in that keyword.

### 10 to 30

This means your keyword doesn't have enough demand or the competition is too high.

### 30 to 50

You'll find many products in this range. You should try to find related keywords with Opportunity Score above 50 and rank for them.

### 50 to 70

This is the sweet spot. And we recommend new sellers to find products with a score above 50 to sell.

### 70 to 100

Finding a score of 90 and above is rare because there are sellers in almost every keyword you imagine. We've seen high scores in new keywords that have lots of searches but not enough sellers to keep up.

If you find one, keep it to yourself because you may have hit a jackpot.

## How is the score calculated?

Shoperware Opportunity Score predicts how well a product will sell in Shopee. It uses an in-house algorithm that considers:
- Demand: sales and units sold.
- Competition: number of sellers and reviews.
- Shopee marketplace economy

The Opportunity Score can change if you search again next week or month. This is due to seasonality and changes in the above factors.

## Where can you use Opportunity Score?

It's now live in (Product Research)[https://app.shoperware.com/product-research] for all paid subscribers.

Search a keyword and the Opportunity Score will appear. It's above the potential revenue and sales.

Go hunt for your next opportunity now.
