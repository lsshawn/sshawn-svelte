Selling on Shopee is getting harder every day.

New products and competitors are coming in each day.

In this 2 minute video, I'm going to show you 2 things:

1. How you can quickly research products that have the potential to sell well
2. How to spy on your competitors to know when they changed prices.

### Product research

If you're not sure if a product can sell, use 'Product Research'.

Quickly get sales estimate to see if there's enough profit to sell.

You can also see sales by brand and seller to see who is dominating.

The next best seller might just be in this list.

### Tracker

When your competitor reduces price, it can hurt your sales.

By using Tracker, you can know when a competitor changed price, picture or added a new product.

Now you can counter them and take action before it's too late.
