# early adopter offer

Currently, I'm doing an 'early adopter' offer for this 6900 plan. It'll be 50% off every year - so that's around 290 a month. And with the promise of no price increase in the future even if I expand this tool to lazada or other countries.

I have 3 more slots left for this offer, so if you'd like to subscribe, I'll reserve a seat for you.
