it's gonna be harder to find products

with huge profit margins and it's gonna

be easier to find products with a

smaller profit margin but you don't want

that profit margin too small or else

you're wasting your time you're not

making much money all right you're

spending all this effort to do something

to make one or two dollars it's not

worth it so the minimum you want is

around five dollars for me five dollars

minimum per unit okay but I personally

only look for products that'll make me

at least \$10 profit per unit to make it

worth my time okay so ten units per day

ten dollars you profit per unit will

make you the hundred dollars profit per

day okay so write that down ten units

per day at ten dollars profit each will

give you the hundred dollars okay

that'll make you two three thousand

dollars profit that you're aiming for

every month all right and that also

means you're selling 300 units per month

ten units per day times thirty days

gives you 300 units okay so write all

that down all right so now that you have

all that written down on a piece of

paper in front of you right we can get

started with a product research all

right so what do you need to do

efficient and effective product research

you need two pieces of software the

jungle Scout web app and the Chrome

extension there's a link in the

description below to the jungle Scout

website click it and you can purchase it

there okay go to jungle scalp click on

products and go on this link the Chrome

extension okay scroll down to the bottom

and you'll see this pro

version you don't need the pro version

okay you just need the lite version okay

you can always upgrade later if you want

it's a one-time fee and click here for

the lite version and you can sign up

right here and it's a one-time fee for

\$97 okay then come up period to products

click on the web app and now bring you

to this page scroll all the way to the

bottom and you don't need the standard

you just need to start up ok the start

up here on the left alright switch it

from annual building to monthly billing

okay it's \$39 a month pick that up and

again if you want the extra features you

can always upgrade later okay but to get

started all you need is the startup

version for \$39 a month click that and

you're good to go so now that you have

those set up ok you should have a little

jungle Scout icon here at the top for

the Chrome extension now login on your

account on the jungle Scout and click on

product database ok you'll be presented

with this page so what is the product

database is a collection of all of the

products in the Amazon Marketplace every

single one of them and it stores every

single specific data point about it ok

right down to the price how many units

they sell how much the product weighs

what the revenue is how many reviews

they have what the ratings are etc etc

ok every single specific detail is in

the database and what's great about that

is that you can set filters for the

criteria that you're looking for and

it'll filter out the products that

you're searching for ok so the first

thing you're gonna want to do is choose

the marketplace that you're in and I'm

assuming most people here are going to

be in the u.s. marketplace so select us

now and the categories here yours

probably going to look different than

mine yours are gonna have the default

category is selected and those are gonna

be all the unguided categories alright

now mine I have a bunch of them

deselected because I just don't want to

sell in those categories and that's a

personal preference so you can choose or

customize it based on what your

preferences

so for example I have automotive turned

off clothing cell phone accessories

electronics toys and games turned off

and I don't want to do those because

those niches are way too competitive or

there's too much return rates on them

like electronics is people return tend

to return a lot more than other category

so I don't want to do with that same

with toys and games and cell phone

accessories and stuff it's just way too

competitive of a niche I don't want to

sell those products okay if you want to

turn them on or off these categories

orange is on and dimmed is off all right

moving on to the filters now remember

when I said you had to write down your

goals and targets before you start our

product research well this is the first

time that information is gonna come in

handy okay and for the filters there's

only a few of these that you need to be

aware of and fill out okay and that's

the price the estimated sales and the

reviews I'm not going to get into any of

the vast product research methods until

later on or in another video okay I

might touch on it a little bit but for

now you're gonna want to set the price

at a price point where you can make your

profit margin comfortably make your

profit margin that includes your

manufacturing costs and the Amazon fees

okay but you don't want to set it too

high either because you want to make

sure the product you're selling is still

an impulse buy to the customer and

generally that's going to be anywhere

from $20 to $50 okay in that price range

now how did I come up with \$20 like I

said you need to make that \$10 proper

margin and include your manufacturing

cost per unit and the Amazon Fulfillment

fees okay

so that \$10 needs to fit in there if you

if the price at the retail price of that

unit is too low for example if you're

trying to sell a \$10 product how are you

gonna make a \$10 profit margin you can't

write if it's $15 that only leaves $5

for your manufacturing costs and Amazon

fees probably not gonna happen either

okay

so \$20 is probably the lowest you want

to go to comfortably make \$10 a profit

per unit now why did I put 1995 because

I want to catch those

other products that are right on the

borderline and same with fifty one

dollars instead of fifty I want to catch

those ones that are a little bit on the

high end of the borderline as well

okay now estimated sales 300 why does

that number look familiar

well you need to sell 300 units per

month right ten units per day to these

at ten dollars profit per unit to make

your hundred dollars profit per day

right that also equals to 10 units per

day times 30 is 300 units per month so

you want to set that at a minimum that

that products that you're filtering out

sell at least 300 per month okay now how

do you determine the competition in that

niche well we use reviews all right the

more reviews a listing has then that

listing probably has a lot of momentum

and people are buying it obviously so

there are a lot of listings in that

niche to have a lot of high reviews then

that niche is probably too competitive

and you want to be weary of it okay so

75 is the number that I use so you don't

want any listings that have more than 75

reviews because it's probably too

competitive

to get in on it so you want if you want

to look for products that have less than

75 okay and I have weight set up to

maximum 2 pounds because you don't want

anything too heavy

otherwise your shipping costs they're

gonna go way up from your manufacturer

and from Amazon okay so you set that at

2 pounds and then over here our product

here you want to do standard size

because anything bigger than standard

size again the Amazon Fulfillment fees

and storage fees are going to be way

higher and you don't want to pay those

ok all right now lastly you'll apply

note you can notice here that I have a

bunch of keywords entered in this

negative keyword field now what does

that mean

that means I further want to eliminate

products that have these keywords in

them because these are products that I

don't want to sell so you can see here

jersey Adidas Nike unarmored those are

all branded products so I don't want to

sell I can't sell them ok and there's

other things in there like sports

memorabilia

and textiles and stuff I don't want to

sell those so I've put those keywords in

there so that if a listing has these

keywords it's not going to show them

okay and I'll kind of scroll through

here so if you want to copy it down you

can okay

and use these in your negative keywords

field as well and lastly you're going to

want to set your results per page to 200

so that you're not constantly paging

through the results and now you can

click search so now you'll notice the

search results has narrowed down from

the millions of products that are on

Amazon to something manageable just shy

of four thousand now if you deviated

from my search criteria you might get

search results of tens of thousands

still now that that would be something

in my opinion that's that's a little too

hard to manage for you to go through all

of those products one by one so you

might want to tighten up the filters a

little bit more to narrow down the

results to something more manageable

like 2,000 to 4,000 product range okay

so now you won't wait what you want to

do is you want to go down this list and

you'll see that the each product has the

criteria that I've set the price the

weight the number of reviews and the

estimated monthly sales now what I do

when I go down this list is I like to

look for products that are a little

curious and out of the ordinary that

catch my eye

okay but at the same time I want to make

sure that I'm avoiding branded products

like major brands and appliances and

stuff that are brands that I recognize

okay and I also want to stay away from

products that will appear to be patented

I don't want to do those because they

can't sell them all right so I'll go

down the list and I also don't want to

do personally electronics anything it

has to do have takes batteries I don't

want to sell those and anything that

goes on or in your body like creams or

anything you have to ingest I don't want

to do those either alright so I scroll

down the list and I find things that

look curious to me and what I'll do is

then I'll if I see something for example

if I see

something here too - what do we got

scroll down

okay like these hanging glass terrariums

these look pretty interesting I don't

know what they are so what I'll do is

I'll right-click on it and open it in a

new tab okay and then I'll keep

searching find some more what I'll do is

I'll find five or six of these in a row

open them in a new tab that way makes

the products features go a lot smoother

and faster instead of doing them one by

one all right so for demonstration

purposes I found three or four products

that caught my eye and the first one

here is the glass terrariums now what I

want to do now is I want to look at the

title and figure out what is the

broadest keyword that's gonna describe

this niche all right I'm not a botanist

and I'm not into planting stuff so I

don't know what a glass terrarium is but

I believe the broadest keyword is glass

terrarium so I'm gonna copy that I'm

gonna paste it here and make sure I

choose all departments and then do a

search now I want to quickly glance down

the list to make sure that what was

pulled up is indeed the glass terrariums

that I'm looking for and it looks like

it is now if it isn't if it doesn't look

like glass terrariums then I didn't

choose the correct keywords okay so be

aware of that so now I can click the

jungle Scout Chrome extension and this

is gonna pull up all the details of all

the listings that are on this page right

and you're gonna see the price the sales

and the reviews which is why now the

second time the goals that you set out

in the beginning are gonna come in handy

okay so I'm gonna look for products that

are at least \$20 so I want to make sure

that what pulled up on this list at

least the top ten of them the average

price is at least \$20 or more okay now

when I glanced down this list I can see

that the average price of the top ten at

least are \$20 or higher that means if I

get into the lit this niche I can

probably sell the product for at least

\$20 all right now secondly I'm going to

go down the sales numbers now

I'm looking for products that sell at

least 300 units per month so I want to

make sure that the top ten at least

seven of the top ten are selling at

least 300 units and I can just count

that one two three there's only four so

unfortunately this is product this niche

is probably not going to work for me

okay because I need all of the

categories that I'm looking for to be a

green light checkmark okay not and all

of them I can't have any of them fail

alright if any of one of those fail I'm

gonna pass on this product all right now

if I move on to reviews I want the

maximum to be 75 so I want at least the

seven out of the top ten to be less than

75 all right so if I go look at the top

ten here I have one two three four five

six there's only six to have less than

seventy-five so another strike against

this one alright so for this product at

least it's a pass I'm not gonna do this

one okay we want the next one now this

one is these double walled insulated

glass coffee mugs now again and we look

at the title and we're trying to

determine what the broadest keyword is

for me to find a list of these products

okay so what I'm going to guess that

these are double walled glass mugs is

what I'm going to assume these are okay

so double walled glass mugs is the

broadest keywords for this niche and

remember select all departments and then

do a search all right now glance down

the list to make sure these are what I'm

looking for it looks like it is so that

is the keyword and then click the jungle

Scout Chrome extension okay

and once again we're gonna make sure all

three of these categories meet my

minimum search criterias that I've

already set in the beginning remember

you should have a piece of paper in

front of you with those written down

okay and all of them have to pass now

first I'm looking at the price \$20 now

can I look at the top ten and see if the

price is at least \$20 the average price

and it looks like I can write around \$20

okay

next we look at the sales they need to

sell at least 300 units per month so do

seven of the top ten sell at least 300

one two three four five so no it doesn't

and the reviews 75 or less deceptive

seven to the top ten have less than 75

reviews one two three four so again not

enough sales and it's too competitive so

pass on this one as well and let's do

one more here for you okay and these are

bamboo coffee filter holders okay so

let's see what the broadest keyword here

is probably a coffee filter holder okay

so when I copy that paste it in the

search make sure I choose all

departments click on search and I'll do

a quick glance and make sure this is the

products that I'm looking for and it

looks like it is okay close enough

anyway let's do the jungle Scout Chrome

extension okay and once again I'm going

to go down the price list here and see

if I can sell this product for at least

twenty dollars okay and at the glance

right now I can see that the majority of

these are below twenty dollars so

probably not unless I can differentiate

and add more value to it

okay such as bundling or improving the

product somehow so I can bump the price

up okay and then secondly I'm look at

the sales column here to see if they're

moving at least 300 and at a glass I can

see probably not because the majority of

these are not over 300

and the reviews max of 75 and so I can

count yours 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 of the top 10

so yeah not as competitive but it failed

in the price and the sales okay so I

don't want to do this one now I want to

also point out that you want to make

sure that the category here isn't brand

dominated so if you see the top 10 here

are all of the same stellar then I would

stay away from that too I would say if

had more than 4 or 5 of them or all the

same seller then I would consider that

brand dominated then I wouldn't sell

this in this niche either because that

one seller owns this market okay so for

example on this one I would pass now

before moving forward I want to

emphasize something here you want to

make sure that all three the price the

sales and the reviews pass your criteria

for the product to be a viable one okay

IP get people sending me screenshots of

this jungle scout results here we're

only one or two of the criteria passed

and they're trying to determine if it's

a viable product or not now this is the

one of the mistakes everybody's making

you have that target the goals on a

piece of paper in front of you you

already figured that out ahead of time

okay so don't teach yourself and don't

try to shortcut yourself or try to

convince yourself that this product is

good you have the numbers in front of

you it needs to pass all of them for you

to move on to the next step so the price

the sales and the reviews all three need

to pass your criteria okay before you

move on all right so let's just say you

do find a viable product what do you do

next you need a product track it for

seven days or longer for you to

determine if the numbers reported in the

jungle Scout Chrome extension are really

the numbers that it's doing okay so what

are you gonna do is let's just say that

this bamboo coffee filter holder is a

viable product and it passed all your

criteria I know it isn't but let's just

assume that it is okay

and so I'm going to copy the URL

I'm gonna go to jungle scout click on

the product tracker I'm going to paste

the URL in here and add to the tracker

now once it's added to the tracker

you'll see that it's popped up here

alright now what we want to do is you

want to click on the view charts and

that's going to pull up a graph of how

many units that this product that this

listing is selling every day now you got

to remember that this chart is an

estimate okay so this long blue bar is

how many units they have in stock and

the dark blue one is how many units

they've sold that day and if you go back

you can see on each day how many units

they've sold ok and let's go back 60

days and let's see and the Green Line is

their seller rank all right and kind of

go back here you can see they're only

selling five units six units a day over

here and then all of a sudden over here

they're selling way more 20 units 22 or

more now why I don't know why but maybe

they're doing a giveaway or something

over here now these numbers are all

estimates your only true way to know how

many units they're selling every day is

to add this product to your cart and do

the \$9.99 cart method but that's beyond

the scope of this video I'm only going

to talk about jungle scouting this one I

have another one explaining how to do

that in another video

okay just keep in mind that these are

estimates okay so why is knowing how

many units this is selling per day

important well I've already determined

that I need to sell at least ten units

per day according to my criteria so I

want to be absolutely certain that this

listing are these this products and

these in this niche is selling at least

ten units per day and I don't want to

use estimated numbers like this

journalist cup product trucker is giving

me I want to know real-life numbers

which the \$9.99 cart method will tell me

so if it's less than ten units per day

then I don't want to sell this product

because it's not I'm not going to hit my

profit margin that I need okay so make

sure you do that so I only showed you

that I added one of these products to

the product tracker but what you really

want to do is you want to add at least

five I like to do ten

the top listings to the product tracker

okay so for example in this this coffee

filter holder I'm going to do the

broadest keyword and do a search again

for the all departments okay and I don't

want to do the sponsored ads I want to

do the organically ranked one so I

already added this guy I don't want to

add that least the top five if not ten

of these products to the product tracker

so this one this one doesn't apply

because it doesn't look like the same

product this one again this doesn't look

the same one either this one this one

and so on okay again top five I like to

do ten of the products to the product

tracker and that way you can get a good

average over seven to ten days or longer

and you'll see a good picture of what

these guys are selling over that time

period and you want to make sure it's

meeting your criteria and in this case

ten units per day all right

so an issue that I'm seeing is a lot of

people are getting into the same niches

and selling the same products now why is

that happening is because everybody's

using the same search criteria you need

to think outside the box to find those

out layers okay products are that are

out there that no one else is seeing now

how do you do that well first of all

this initial product list that you see

here is what I like to call the first

level everybody's seeing these same

products okay you need to get away from

that like two three four five layers

deeper okay it's kind of like Inception

a dream within a dream within a dream is

this a dream so how do you move away

from this initial search list well for

example if we go back to this copy

filter holder you can move one layer

deeper by going down to related products

for example going through this and

seeing anything catches your eye and if

it does now your one level away okay and

then you can always go down to similar

items for example or people who bought

this also bought that products list okay

see if anything else catches our

here that'll move you one layer away

from the initial jungle scout search

results okay another idea is to go this

is the this is the sellers storefront if

you click on the sellers name you can

see what other products he's selling and

this guy only has two products but other

stores might have 10 20 50 other items

that you can go through and see if

anything their cache drive okay that'll

move you another layer away from the

jungle scout search results okay the

farther you can move away from that

initial search results the more likely

you're gonna find those outlier products

that no one else has seen okay four five

six layers deeper ideally okay now you

can explore further by tweaking your

search criteria a little bit okay now if

you have a little bit more starting

capital you can for example search in a

higher price range

don't go low or go higher so for example

50 to \$75 range okay that'll pull up a

list of products that other people

aren't going to normally see alright

another way is for example find products

that have room for improvement that have

a low rating okay so for example find

products that have a maximum of three

point seven stars right then that means

that's going to show you a slightly

different list of products and it gives

you something to differentiate with you

can improve on that product by looking

at the reading the reviews and seeing

what the customers are complaining about

and fixing those problems okay or you

can go look at the listing quality

alright another way to differentiate you

make a better listing so it's a listing

number out of a hundred so for example

only so show listings that have a

maximum listing quality of of 60 out of

100 for example and that would give you

something to differentiate with by

improving the listings okay so I hope

that shows you different methods to find

products that other people aren't seeing

because everybody's using the same

search criteria alright guys so that's

how I do product research now I want to

emphasize that this is not a race okay

product research is the most important

part of Amazon FBA

you need to set yourself up for success

right from the beginning and take the

time to find a good product okay because

if you try to shortcut it or speed up

this process and you end up with a bad

product no matter how well you do

everything beep after that your product

will not sell well so take your time

follow the steps I've outlined here and

find a good product if you have any
