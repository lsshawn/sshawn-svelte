# How to use product research

Say you're considering to sell 'popcorn' in Shopee.

There are two things that you'd want to know:

1. What the selling price in the market?
2. How much can you expect to earn?

Knowing these data ahead can help you save thousand of dollars from sourcing the wrong product.

With Shoperware **'Product Research'** tool, you can quickly validate a product idea.

Enter a keyword to search and you'll see stats such as median price and sales over the last 30 days. This gives you an idea of how much you can make in this keyword if you're just an average seller in this keyword.

By default, Product Research will retrieve the first page of the search result - 50 products in total. We find that this is a good estimate but you can load more pages to see more products.

Scrolling down, you'll see a table of products. Click on any column headers to sort. In the screenshot below, we've sorted by 'Last 30 days sales (RM)' and saw the product that sold the most in the last 30 days.

More interestingly, you'll be able to see variations sales data. This can help you know the market demand and prioritize which variation to sell.

## Filters

Use filters to fine tune your search results.

You may want to exclude ads if you want to study organic sales number.

You'll sometimes see product with 'not for sale' in its title and priced at \$999. This is why we exclude not for sale items by default.

Use 'product title' filter to get products that contains an exact phrase.
