Ask for proof that what you’ve done has actually helped.

Ask your customers to talk about a specific objection they had before buying your product, and how they felt about that objection once they’ve completed it.

Ask what is one thing about your product that surprises them.

To improve the likelihood that I get video testimonials, I let customers know that I’ll feature the best ones, plus a link to that person’s social media, at the top of my landing page.

Use testimonial.to.
