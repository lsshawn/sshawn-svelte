Some people including doctors say it's okay to take medicines that expired 2 years ago.

Some disagree.

Some would even think it's poisonous and could cause death.

It's not worth to get into fights on which is correct. There's none.

You could spend hours googling and you thought you found an answer, you didn't.

You just found enough reasons to believe what you believe.

Just buy a new medicine if you don't believe.
