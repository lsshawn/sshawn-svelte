# Buying niche sites

1. 2 years+ expenses.

- See any big drops in expenses.
- See expenses before they are actively looking for seller. They tend to spend less when they are looking to sell.

2. GA account for traffic sources

- Don't overvalue bounce rate
- > 70% new visitors
- > 70% organic traffic.
- Make sure you can maintain those traffic sources.

3. Look for undervalued assets

- email list & newsletter
- digital products
- unoptimized ads
