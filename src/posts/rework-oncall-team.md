We have an on-call team that works on some of these things. Sometimes in the down times between cycles, someone might pick off a few bugs that they wanna solve, they wanna fix that have been bothering them or bothering customers. Sometimes some of these things can be handled by someone on support depending on what they are. If it’s not really a bug necessarily but it’s an issue a customer is confused about or doesn’t understand or something, you just kind of figure that out. But there are people that are dealing with reactive work here that are not dealing with the proactive work. So proactive work is a scheduled work. Reactive work is the stuff that bubbles up and comes up and there are teams and procedures in place for that. What we don’t do is stop everything when there’s a bug, unless it’s a critical code red kind of thing where like there’s data loss or something significant, right? It’s what we just don’t say, okay we have to fix every bug until we can move on to something else. We accept that some bugs are going to exist, they’re gonna be okay, they’re not critical. They might affect a small portion of the customer base.
