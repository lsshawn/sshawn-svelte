## Ladder 1. Minimum Viable Customer

Spend 3-6 months to get 2000 email subscribers.

Each blog post is a chance for a new idea.

Test: Will you be comfortable telling your grandma about what you do?

Offer consulting (hourly).

Focus on messaging and getting people to subscribe.

## Ladder 2. Focus on getting 6 figures ARR

Goal: 6 figures in 1 year

The rule of 5/1. Get super deep. Limit yourself to:
- 1 product
- 1 conversion mechanism
- 1 traffic source
- 1 year to test
- 1 year to achieve $1mn

Focus on providing value.

5 commandments:
- only have 1 business
- Only 1 offer
- After launch, spend only 1 day per month on product creation. You need to focus on selling
- Don't spend more than 1 day on content marketing (unless it's your primary source)
- Find beauty in depth rather than width

Steps:
- Create a product
- Create an offer (guarantee, payment plan, pricing)
- Conversion process (landing page, eg)
- Get traffic

## Ladder 3

Goal: 7 figures

- Upsell: something 5-10x more expensive
- Automation
- Conversion and traffic test
