This is the outline I used for a 4 day course on VueJS to US Navy.

## How this course is delivered

At the end of this course, students will know all the important concepts of VueJS to build a front-end app.

This course starts at the very basic of VueJS and brings students up-to-date with latest development in VueJS used by developers today.

This training consists of lectures and short exercises for students to have hands-on opportunity to build mini apps.

I'll screen share and provide live coding lectures. There'll be no handouts as I'll present the concepts directly from Vue official documentation.

Students can work on the exercises without any installation. We'll use online code editors such as JSFiddle.net and CodeSandbox.io. There'll be ample time for Q&A during the exercise sessions.

Students requirements:

- Basic knowledge in Javascript
- Basic HTML and CSS knowledge
