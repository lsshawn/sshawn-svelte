Unfortunately, you don’t get much iodine from freshwater fish.

So now we can supplement with TRH, which stimulates the TSH, and that stimulates the thyroid gland, but doctors who rely strictly on TSH testing are going to tell people, “Well, look at that, your TSH is low, that must mean your free T3 and free T4 are enough for you.” Excuse me; it often means your hypothalamus is malfunctioning. It’s crucial to look at all those hormones—free T4, free T3, TSH, all three—because if that TSH is low, and the T4 is high or high normal, then as a doctor you’d expect the TSH to be low. But if both the free T4 and the TSH are low, that usually means enough TRH isn’t being made by the hypothalamus to stimulate the T4 and free T4.
