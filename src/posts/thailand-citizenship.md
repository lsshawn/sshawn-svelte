Obtaining a citizenship through naturalization is tough.

Property ownership rules towards foreigners are restrictive.

## Typo O Visa

Thailand does not have an explicit retirement program but rather a one-year visa that you can then extend one year at a time. It’s called the non-immigrant type “O” visa. You’re allowed to bring your spouse, and children under 19 years old if they attend a school in Thailand.

Requirements:

- At least 50 years old
- show proof of solvency with:

### Option 1. 800,000 baht deposit in a Thai bank.

Keep it for 3 months after you get your visa. After that you must keep 400,000 baht in your deposit account.

Thai immigration always keep the original financial document, so you'll need these every year for renewing. You'll need:

- 12 months bank statement
- minimum 800,000 baht deposit again

Other notes:

- Your 800,000 cannot be in money market or stock. It must be savings to term deposit.
- If you bring your spouse, you need marriage certificate. Bring your cert to your embassy in Thailand and make a sworn affidavit. Or in your home country, go to Thai embassy and get it stamped for authenticity.

### Option 2. 65,000 baht monthly income

Transfer every month into your Bangkok Bank. It's simpler to use Option 1.

### Option 3. Deposit + income combination

This is the most paper work intensive.

## Tax residence

You'll be a tax residence if you spend 180 days in Thailand.

Thailand is a residence-based tax, i.e. your worldwide income is taxed.
