It's the 21st century way of saying "Get lost."

Of course I know how to google. But I'm less keen on the correct answer. I'm trying to chat with you. I want to know what you think.

The world would be dead silent if everyone google themselves.

So the next time someone asks you, have a conversation.

Ask "How do you feel?"

Help them to understand by going to first principle.

At the very least, google together and laugh at the suggested search.
