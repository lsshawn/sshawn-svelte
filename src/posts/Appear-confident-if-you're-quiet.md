# Appear confident if you're quiet

:charisma:body-language:confidence:

1. Slow movement
2. Eye contact:
  1. Hold to show you're intimidated
  2. Look down to deescalate
  3. To defuse without projecting fear, hold 3 seconds eye contact then look to the side.
3. Non-reactive
4. Expand your hands when talking to groups
5. Show conviction in your language. Don't say 'I hope to/I want to'. Say 'I will'.
6. Tone: end your speech with a downward note. Speak slowly and pauses.
7. Carrot/stick thinking.
   - Carrot: Don't focus on 'I'. Say "I feel like I can provide more value for the company and play at a higher level. What would you need to see from me in the next 3 months to promote me?"
   - Stick: Get a job offer outside to counter.
