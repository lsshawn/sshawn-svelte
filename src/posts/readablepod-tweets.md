@ShaanVP @thesamparr I've fulfilled your gentlemen agreement but I need to confess...ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ

I don't listen to your podcast. I read them.

Lately I met more people like me who prefer to read podcasts bcos we don't hit the gym.

Thus I built ReadablePod.com this weekend.

I used to keep these transcripts for myself. That was selfish of me.

90% accurate with machine learning assistance.

Correct punctuations unlike YouTube captions.

Time synced word by word so readers can read and listen. Best of both world, @BenWilsonTweets.
