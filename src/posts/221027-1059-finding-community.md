This is me thinking through "The Minimalist Entrepreneur" questions:

- If I talk, who listens?
- Where and with whom do I already spend my time, online and offline?
- In what situations am I most authentically myself?
- Who do I hang out with, even though I don’t really like them, but it’s worth it since we share something more important in common?

- small business owners who are looking to sell online
- programmers
- 9-5 workers looking to start a business themselves
- freelancers
- passive, benchmark investing
- people who wants to automate their business
- people who values privacy
- minimalist
- Digital nomad
