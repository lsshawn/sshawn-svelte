Hotel booking requires more work than initially thought. 

I should focus on marketing to businesses who provide services only.

Pet groomers who provide hotel bookings are for next phase.


Here are some spec for hotel booking.

Hotel booking
- book 2 night
- book 3 days 2 nights
- book date range
- for room type
- for number of pax
- number of rooms == consecutive services
- ignores holiday, but considers special days as blocked dates

Feature creep.

Can a chatbot replace remote control?
