How much time am I spending making versus managing?

Are you doing what you’re uniquely capable of? What you feel placed here on Earth to do? Can you be replaced?”

If you say no to one, you say no to all”

I also do 80-20 analysis probably once every two to four weeks on my inputs and outputs to try to remove as much as possible and focus on a handful of very powerful, hopefully powerful, Archimedes’ levers in my life.

It is better to fail in freedom than to succeed in chains?

Ask why 3 times.
