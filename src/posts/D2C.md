# Tiered pricing

`Pricing is $10 for first 30 orders, but increases after`

Creates urgency and remove burden of setting price.

# FOMO

Example: Nugget Comfort

- Introduce limited editions.
- Bring back old colors for limited runs.
- Lottery system to buy before Christmas

# Pre-launch

Speak to 500 people. Refine your product until you have 100 people eager to buy.

# Thunderclap

Partner with influencer.

Film a cinematic commercial for pre-sales and official launch.

Send to beta-testers to get feedback and community talking.

Example: [Bala footwear](https://www.facebook.com/BALANurseShoes/videos/319657059307561)

# Launch

Keep making noise every 2-4 weeks:
- product launch
- collaborations
- community engagement, giveaways, rewards

Early on, you need to give reasons for people to love your brand.

Later on, you need to pick a fight in public. Pick:
- Status quo
- Brands that aren't innovating

Example: [ThirdLove vs. Victoria Secret](https://www.instagram.com/p/BqVS-aTlvIt)

# Retention

Customize experience via:
- geography
- age
- profession

# How to validate and launch a DTC

1. Validate
- Interest over time (reddit, google search)
- Competition growth, dollar raised and margins.
- Search volume and bid for similar keywords
- Social media: follower growth, what are they discussing, like/dislikes
- Talk to 300 people and see if they'll buy.

2. Differentiate
- Find complains in reviews, comments and tweets. Use them as your hook.
- Run 3 Facebook ads with slightly different hook. Budget $1000. The one with highest CTR wins.

3. Build a website

4. Advertise
- Copy competitors' ads with Facebook Ads library.
- Always capture email (e.g. Klaviyo, Mailchimp)

5. Inventory & Logistics
- Have suppliers to package for you.
- Partner with bank for cash flow
- Fulfillment with Shopify or Shipstation

6. Hiring
- Hire customer service first.
