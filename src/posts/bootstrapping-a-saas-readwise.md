The consensus:

| desc                 | enterprise        | consumer        |
|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| revenue per customer | massive           | tiny ($5 - 10)  |

Contrarian view:
- Consumer SaaS is less crowded.

- You're building for human.

Caveats:
- Need millions of users to attract VC. Best to start with niche.
- Long, slow SaaS ramp of death (Gail Goodman of Constant Contact).
  - $10/mo takes a lot of customer to survive
