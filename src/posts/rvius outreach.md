# Messaging general guide

Separate each line in a new message.

Long messages turn off people.

Don't directly copy-paste the template. Reply naturally like chatting with a friend. Then send the template.

You can personalise the message if you feel it'll make it more natural.

Follow up each unanswered message in 7 days.

## DM 1

Hi [name], I visited your [cafe/restaurant/place] a few times and you have one of the best [insert popular thing].

I feel that you deserve more reviews on Google Map.

That would bring more customers to you, don't you think so?

## DM 2

[Reply to their reply first. Be natural]

I'd love to help.

I've built a new app to help businesses like yours to get more reviews by rewarding customers.

You can check it out at Rvius (https://rvius.com).

What do you think about this idea?

## DM 3, or if they didn't reply DM 2

### Wait for them to reply, then send this

It's a new app I built called Rvius (https://rvius.com).

I wanted to help businesses like yours to get more reviews by rewarding customers.

Do you think this will help you get more new customers?
