Specialization is for insects. You've got one life, just do everything you're going to do

Read the best 100 books over and over again until you absorbed them, rather than read all the books.

Desire is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want. Don't have too many desires and don't pick them up unconsciously. Better coffee, better apps...

A happy, calm, peaceful person, will make better decisions and have better outcomes. Tame your mind.

Modern knowledge worker should work like an athlete - train hard, then you sprint, then you rest, then you reassessed.

Smart people are starting to work more remotely on their own schedule. That's actually how we are the most productive.

On universal basic income, if I give you money then I need to give you meaning. And meaning comes through education and capability.

Give basic housing, get basic food, get basic transportation, get high speed internet access, get a phone in your pocket. Then we should focus on giving equal opportunities.

Automation is not a problem. Electricity replaced lots of jobs. Creativity is the last frontier.

Modern life was so free. We stand alone. You got a lot of freedoms. But when they attack you, you're alone and you can't resist. Porn, social media, sugar...

So the modern struggle is learning how to resist these things in the first place. Draw your own boundaries.

Most of modern life diseases are diseases of abundance, not diseases of scarcity.

Meditation - do anywhere and do nothing. It's self therapy. Listen to yourself and work through each of them.
