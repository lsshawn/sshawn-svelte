If you want to be successful and make a real contribution to the world, you have to be intrinsically motivated by the work you do, and you have to feel good about spending your days on it.

You don't need to love your work.

Love might grow – and it’s a wonderful thing if it does - but you don’t need it up front.

You can succeed just by wanting something to exist that doesn't already.
