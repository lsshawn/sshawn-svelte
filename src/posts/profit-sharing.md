Sample example:

Allocate 10% of company profit to plan.

Spread among X employees.

Reevaluated % each year.

Downside is this is taxed as income (bonus), not dividend. So it's higher tax.

Additional structures:

- Create a secondary market for them to buy/sell
- Vest over time
- Delayed payments
