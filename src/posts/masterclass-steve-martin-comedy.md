What if...?

What haven't been talked about?

Think about comedy all the time.

Learn about new things.

Keep gathering information. When there's an argument, just observe without taking sides.

You're a thought machine. Every thing that happen to you is valuable.

Just saying the truth - what everyone is thinking - is funny.

Not going by the book gives you originality.

Have a manifesto: e.g. Being funny without saying a joke.

Make yourself the subject.

> "I walked into the bar."

Set expectation, then twist it.

> I used to do drugs. I still do, but I used to do.

## Opening act

Don't say "How are we doing tonight?" because:

- you've blown the 15 secs to capture attention.
- you're asking the audience to participate right away - which is bad.
