## How and why to decentralize your project

You need to think how the product can run in a community owned and operated manner.

Three objectives of a crypto app:

1. Build a product people want

- You'll still have a core team holding control to the app.
- It's a good sign if users complain of lack of decentralization. It means they care.

2. Build a community

- Open source docs
- Developer evangelism
- Bounties and grants
- Decide incentives and token distribution

2. Give ownership to the community

- Airdrop
