# Loans

Using loan is asking your future self to pay for your expenses.

It makes no sense if your growth (interests) rate is less than the loan interest rate.

It's living above your means.

# Pershing Square Holdings

Bill created this holdings company to solve liquidation of investors assets. Why?

# Minimalist personal finance

## Getting started is the hardest part

Just start.

Get all your bank balances and enter.

Don't worry about the past.

Now start tracking all expenses.

On budgeting, if you always find yourself cash strap at the end of month, you should create a budget. I skip budgeting for every category of my life because I know I'm frugal and have more than 20% of income as savings.

On expense tracking, it's okay to not track everything. Here are some rules I set for myself:

- If it's food or small leisure activity with cash, I don't track it. I count the cash in my wallet at the end of the week and create a 'cash distribution'. Maybe 80% food, 20% leisure

```
2014-06-19 * "Cash distribution"
  Expenses:Food:Restaurant           402.30 USD
  Expenses:Leisure:Snooker              100.00 USD
  Assets:Cash                     ; -502.30 USD

2014-06-20 balance Assets:Cash       194.34 USD
```

There are so many smaller currencies.

Trend following with momentum based trigger will capture trends in any currencies.

Agnostic to any currency.

# 2019-11-07 Property Investment

Buying a property is a bad investment.

Buying properties is an okay investment.

How do you know if that one property you invest is going to appreciate the most compared to other properties in your city, country or world?

This applies to buying a stock.
