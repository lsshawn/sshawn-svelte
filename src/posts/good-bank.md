4 pillars:

1. Bank
2. Deposit insurance
3. Central bank
4. Government

## Bank

- High capitalization or solvency ratio (total equity / total asset). Higher is better. Prefer 10% above.
- Low loan-to-deposit ratio.
- Low total liquidity ratio (cash / liabilities due to customer)
- High reserve ratio (Canada has none. US is 10%)
- Low NPL loans
- No reporting tricks like classifying bonds as 'available for sale' (AFS) or 'hold to maturity' (HTM)
