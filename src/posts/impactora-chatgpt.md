# Improve advice with ChatGPT

Let's say you have a prompt for ChatGPT to rewrite the advice: 'Please rewrite the text below in a more casual tone.'

Copy-pasting from ChatGPT and Airtable can be time consuming for 3800+ advice.

ChatGPT has an API that we can leverage to automate this task. It has a free trial now. You can view their pricing here: https://openai.com/api/pricing/. All these solutions require you to have a API key and incur some fee to ChatGPT in the future.

### Solution 1: Bulk generate for you

I can code a script that generates and add ChatGPT responses in a new column directly in Airtable.

Then you'll have to go into Airtable to pick and edit which responses you want to use.

One benefit is that we can reuse this script for any any prompts you want and add a new column in Airtable.

The downside is because it's a script, you'll need to know how to run it in your laptop if you want to run it yourself. It's quite easy to setup within 10 minutes.

Cost:

There's no interface for this.

The only the work is to code the script to query ChatGPT and update Airtable.

The development is 4 hours ($400), including running 5 prompts for you.

### Solution 2: Google Chrome extension

I came up with this as a tool that you may even use for yourself.

Let me explain in this video demo:

The benefit is you can use this for any tasks outside of Impactora.

The downside is that this tool will be free to use for everyone in Chrome later. But you can turn this into a marketing tool.

Cost:

Developing this tool will take around 14 hours of effort ($1400).

There's no server or running cost to maintain this extension.

# Chat between impact partners

The easiest way is to allow user to input a contact link in their profile.

The contact link can be slack, teams, or whatsapp number.

Then impact partners can click on the link to chat outside of Impactora.

This would only take 2 hours of development.

But because the conversation happens outside of Impactora, you won't be able track or control what they are chatting. Even a chatbot won't be able to read their entire chat history because of privacy concern.

Alternatively, you can build a build a chat interface inside Impactora. A full chat feature can take weeks to complete because we need a server to host and store live chat. We also need to take care of some security to check if the user has the right to chat or read a message.

# Impact advice

We need to capture and store clicks on these four actions:

1. Feed click
2. Rate action
3. Click on organization information
4. Click on reminder

Fee: $1500
