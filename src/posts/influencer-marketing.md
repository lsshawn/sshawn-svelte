# Influencer

Understand why people are following the influencer.

It must fit the audience.

If the audience only wants to be entertained, doing an paid promotion will turn off the audience.

# Sourcing influencers

Post campaign briefs at #paid.

They must:
- love the product
- willing to produce a testimonial video
- run ads through the creator profile. (Facebook partnership tools)

# Let them create the content

Give them your value propositions, explanations, and products. Then let them lead.

4 guides:
- Fast-paced intro
- Product shown in first 3 seconds
- Main value proposition in 10 seconds
- Clear explanation of why

# Blast the person with products

Send 108 products to influencers. There's no way they'll not talk about it.
