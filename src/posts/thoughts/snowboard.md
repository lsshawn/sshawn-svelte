# buttering

Move hips, imagine a dot at the tail.

Keep back knees open, not closed. 

# intermediate turn

Hand over tail to keep square

Front knee out for heel turn. In for toe turn.

Keep angle downhill because you're controlling speed during the turn.

If you're having sideslips to sideslips, you have too much weight at the front. Keep your hips centred. Try 4 hops while turning. Or try turning up hill.
# garland exercise to change edge faster

Get down low. Work those legs to change back and forth.


Heel edge hips back

Toe edge hips forward

As you change edge from heel to toe, bring hips in front.

Front toe to start the turn.

Back foot to grip.


At the end of heel turn, Stand up to drop into toe edge.

At the end of toe edge, stand up and sit.

Tighten up the carve. Push your legs by extending your legs.

# exercise

To train controlling pressure on edges to prevent chattering:

Go straight down. Then heel stop as fast as u fan. Hop 3 times up. You'll fall if legs are too straight.

Do the same for toe edge. Hop 3 times down.

Upper body and lowerbody must be aligned with board. Always heading the same direction. All turn in same direction. Imagine a pole through ur body.

Hips centered. When u turn, try hopping 

Try riding turns uphill. If you cant, you're putting too much pressure on front. Put more pressure behind.

# how to turn

Look ahead to ur next turn.

Turn shoulder.

Think about twisting your feet.

Press front first, then back.

Bend front more than back to prevent leaning back. 

Commit.

Pressure front foot until edge change.
