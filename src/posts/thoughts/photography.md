### ISO

The first thing to set. The higher the number, the more sensitive to light - more grainy picture.

Keep ISO as low as possible.

Why camera are pricey? You pay more to get more light.

### Aperture (f/)

The size of lens opening.

The smaller the number, the bigger the hole and more light comes in.

Controls depth of field.

The lower the f/, the smaller the depth of field.

If shooting 1 person, shoot with low aperture: f/2. If group photo, f/3.5. If landscape, f/16.

### Shutter speed

The amount of seconds the shutter is open. Controls motion blur.

Slow shutter speed to capture waterfall.

Fast shutter speed for action shots.

Portrait: 1/250 to 1/500.

Walking: 1/800.

Low light: 1/100.

Sports: 1/800

### Debug

If image too dark:
1. Slow shutter speed
2. Lower aperture
3. Raise ISO

1. Lower ISO

# 2019-12-23 Why do we post travel pictures on Instagram

Is it to show off to friends?

"Hey I'm travelling now and you're stuck at the office!"

Is it to keep as memory?

As soon as you arrive at a new place, you pull out your phone and start snapping.

Did you notice the old man sitting by the bench?

Can you hear the seagull sound?

Close your eyes 6 months later and see if you can replay this scene.

Soak in the environment.
