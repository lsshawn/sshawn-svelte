# 2019-10-15 Bitcoin as a gift

I was getting invited to lots of 1-year-old birthday party lately.

Red packets being the norm, I chose Bitcoin instead.

A 1 dollar gift will be 1 dollar when the kid graduate.

But 1 Bitcoin could cover the kid's university fee - or not at all.

Even if Bitcoin prices fall to zero, that friend will still remember my gift.

First I create a new wallet in Electrum for my friend.

Then I transfer some of my Bitcoins to this new wallet.

Finally I give instructions to access this wallet in this handwritten template

```
Happy 1st birthday, [Name]. This is your first Bitcoin wallet.
