# Dave Kaminski - Facebook ads for regular people

Facebook ads are not intent-based driven. People are not actively searching for a solution to a problem.

So don't go directly for a sale. Ask for an email. Then market to them forever via email.

Create 1 campaign, 1 ad set, 1 ads to keep it clean. Don't have 1 campaign with multiple ads.

Wordpress plugin: Pixel Caffeine

## Facebook police

Facebook doesn't allow anything personally identifiable in an ad.

E.g. "Attention women over 50, here's how to..."

Two solutions:

- "How I..."
- List: "7 ways to reduce..."

## Lead Magnet

Spend the least amount of time generating a lead magnet.

Most people won't bother to read your PDF.

## Video vs Image

Only use video if:

- it demonstrates your product.
- talking head to provide trust.
- has animal that relates to your product.

Video shouldn't be longer than 30 seconds.

You can add captions to video.

Image must always have a face or animal.

Don't put any text in image.

Your purpose is to **generate curiosity to click**.

## Landing page

The simpler the better.

Visitors must know what to do within 3 seconds.

Make separate thank you page to track conversion

Facebook tracking:

- Event: Lead
- Exact URL

## Creating FB campaign

1. Go to 'ads manager'
2. Select 'conversion'
3. Campaign naming: Add '(m)' to label campaign for mobile to split test.
4. In Ads Set, set conversion event as 'lead'.
5. Keep 'detailed targeting' to minimum to allow Facebook algorithm to work.
6. Select manual placement to optimize.

- Select only Facebook
- mobile or desktop
- Facebook news feed only

If you're not targeting a local market, get 500,000 potential reach or more so that Facebook algorithm will work well and you'll never run out of people to market to.

If you have large number, turn off 'detailed targeting expansion'.

Example of ads:

- Primary text: How I get rid of stress with a box of crayons
- Headline: Got crayons? Then get this
- Copy and paste into description to maintain formatting.

## The only stats that matters

Your lead cost.

If your lead cost is $5, 100 leads will cost $500.

2% of those leads will buy. That's 2 people.

Your product needs to be priced at \$250 to break even.

If your product is $5, you need to bring your lead cost to $1.

## Understanding stats

- Reach: people who saw your ads
- Results: lead or purchase

If you have low click-reach ratio, you have a problem with targeting and ads.

If you have low link-result ratio, you have a problem with your landing page.

## Scaling

Don't increase budget on successful ads. The Facebook algorithm is tied to your budget.

Solution:

- Every 3 days, increase your budget by 10%
- Pause current ad and create a new ad with a higher budget.

## Pro

- Custom audience: people who visited a certain page on your site.
- Retargeting

These will be cheaper and convert better.

## Track conversion

- Add new custom conversion
- Website event: Purchase event
- Change URL to Event Parameters
- 'content_name' equals 'your_product'
- Name your conversion name 'Purchase - your product'
- Leave value blank.

```
fbq('track', 'Purchase', {
content_name: 'your_product',
value: 0.00,
currency: 'USD'
})
```

Setup custom facebook report in ads manager. Show custom conversion columns.

- Only use conversion
- Conversion: Website -> select custom conversion name. It's ok if it's greyed or red. It'll turn green when active.
- Use automatic placements to allow Facebook to optimize.
- Conversion window: 1 day click. Use 7 days if you're doing a sequence.
- Duplicate ad set for each targeting group.

## Campaign setup

- Campaign A
- Ads sets:
  - Interest A
  - Interest B
  - No targeting
- Use same ads in all ads sets. If you use 3 variations in an ad set, use them in all your ads sets.

## Custom audiences

You can upload a CSV of audiences.

## Perfect ads

- Headline: ask a question
- Image: grab attention
- Description: make a promise. E.g. you'll get a video to 10x your sales

Don't create multiple ads to do detailed targeting like 'Tim Ferriss' or 'Gary V' because there are overlaps in these. You'll end up paying more. Target this way:

- small biz
- email marketing
- fans page admins
- entrepreneur

These are big markets. Cover as much of your market with little overlap.

## 2 step ads scaling

1. Start big.

Set budget at campaign level.

Optimize throughout the day.

Go live or make changes at midnight.

2. Double double

If $1000 budget is working, double it to $2000. Double it until conversion decreases.

No fixed time frame. You can continue doubling in a day.

## Custom reporting

- Link clicks
- CTR
- CPC
