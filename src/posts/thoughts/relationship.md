# 2020-07-10 2nd letter

Jun,

Hearing your voice completes my day.

But every time I hang up the phone with you, I felt I've not completed something...

I've not told you how I feel about you.

I think about you a lot - that's why I have to put my thoughts on paper.

You're someone special, deserving all the happiness, care and love you can get.

And I hope to be by your side to give these to you.
