# Traffic Engine - Andre Chaperon

Your product is not your offer.

Offer fails 80% of the time, but it doesn't mean your product is failing.

People are searching for:

- your name (lowest volume, highest quality)
- your product (high quality and volume)
- if they knew what you offer, they might be interested. No active intent in search (e.g. "how to fix a leaky roof")

Think about where you'll get traffic before creating the offer.

**4 key numbers:**

1. CPA (cost per acquisition)
2. AOV (average order value or the first sale)
3. LTV. How much customer will spend over time after the first sale.
4. Return on Ad Spend (ROAS). Calculate at keyword level.

```
Example calculation:

It cost $1 to bring people to our page.

Landing page conversion to sales is 1.5%.

Total ad spend is $100.

CPA: $100/1.5 = $67.

Consider your AOV and LTV against CPA to see if your strategy is working.
```

Your goal is to provide value that your AOV and LTV are so high that your CPA is irrelevant.

Don't retarget to all your visitors. Retarget to visitors who stayed longer than 10 seconds at your site.

Work backwards instead of pushing more traffic. Think why some visitors didn't buy. The deeper someone is in your buyer's journey, the more valuable that person is. Ask:

- What is she thinking?
- What are her concerns or objections?
- What can you offer to reinforce your credibility?
- How can you make her decision to move forward easier?

Google users want quick answers. They think "what is...", "how do I..." or "what's the best way to...".

Facebook users want personal, social and entertaining. They aggregate around beliefs and desires.

All offers or ads have 1 goal to optimizing: Is this likely to contribute to the creation of a happy, long-term customer?

## Value Proposition Design Canvas (VPDC)

1. Identify an audience
2. Their jobs or what they need to accomplish
3. Pains
4. Gains
5. Our product
6. Ways our product relieves pains
7. Ways our product create gains

## Google ads

You can bid low and have good result because Google uses Quality Score.

Keyword matches:

1. Broad. Don't use this - it's a waste.
2. Phrase. "chocolate gift basket"
3. Exact. (chocolate gift basket)
4. Modified broad. +chocolate +gift +basket. All must appear in any order. Includes similar word variant.
5. Negative. -free

We want very specific search phrases that show clear buying/action intent.

### Steps:

To find one keyword phrase that's specific enough, relevant and gets enough traffic (at least 10 clicks per day):

1. What would you search for to find what you offer?
2. Search and see what ads appear.
3. Look at Google's suggestions
4. Make 25+ keyword phrases of 3 words+
5. Organize by problem/solution. Language/query.
6. Order by specificity

### Perfect keywords

- buy red widgets online
- buy red widgets online free shipping

It's okay to be specific with less traffic.

List how one will search for exactly what you offer.

Then identify one keyword phrase. Then use negative matches to eliminate lower quality traffic.

E.g.
+learn +email +marketing
-free -cheap -inexpensive -login -article -video -PDF

Recommend:

- turn off mobile and tablet traffic initially.
- geography is the most important factor.
- set timing. Don't advertise on weekend if you're B2B.

```
E.g. a writer's retreat.

Create 3 tiers of campaign:
1. Target states where people are within driving distance to the retreat.2
2. Target states where people can drive or fly within in a day.
3. Target states that the next closes state have a direct flight.
```

### Components of Google ads:

1. Final URL. Best if more specific
2. Headline 1 & 2. No exclamation point.
3. Display path 1 & 2. Automatically done by Google.
4. Description. Only 1 exclamation point.

First imagine the outcome the person searching the term wants.

Reverse engineer by searching keyword phrases and collect ads by your competitors. If you notice ad copy is different across search term, study those ads. Unsavvy advertisers don't test. Paid solution: Spyfu.

Use years of your competitor experience to develop a starting point.

### Extensions

Best are:

1. Sitelinks. 6 on desktop, 4 on mobile.
2. Callouts. Draw attention to features.

### Do

1. not use too many keywords in a single ad group.

Build one search phrase per ad group.

2. not send to your home page.

Send to specific page.

3. not use broad keywords

4. not spread budget too thin across too many campaigns

5. use negative keywords

6. use ad variants.

Test major differences, not punctuations.

7. track conversions

8. track every day, max weekly.

9. manage ads by performance, not budget.

Plan for minimum 10 clicks per day at first.

Turn off location and phone to not mess up your targeting.

### Metrics

In Google Ads:

- quality score
- clickthrough rate
- average cost per click
- clicks
- impressions
- search impression share (if you're getting 95% of the traffic already, don't waste time)
- conversion rate
- cost per conversion

In Google Analytics:

- bounce rate
- average session duration
- pages / session
- goal conversion
- goal funnel metrics

There's no one good score. Your business doesn't generate revenue from score.

High quality score or CTR means nothing if you don't have a target cost per conversion.

Metrics means nothing if you don't know the target cost per conversion. Fix those over your target.

Average cost per conversion means nothing - it gives you nothing to act on.

```
Case study:

You spent $40,343 on a campaign
that produced 40 customers
at an average cost of $1,009/customer - your CPA.

Your target CPA was $800.

At campaign level, it wasnt' successful.

Look deeper to see what we can fix.

For keywords that are within target CPA, leave them on.

For keywords that exceed target CPA and have no potential, turn them off.

If there's potential, tweak the keyword. Look at Search Term report to see what keywords triggered the conversion. Elimate low quality searches.

Or create a specific landing page for that search query.
```

## Facebook ads

Facebook is edutainment.

Favorite ads are those that change perspective. Show a new way of thinking that prospects are already thinking about. Provide expect commentary.

The single most important question on writing FB ads: "how likely is someone willing to share this ad?" Create ads that make your prospects look smart when they share it.

### Prequalify in ads

If you lead with curiosity, focusing on all the secrets that will be revealed in your product, you'll get a mixed prospects. This doesn't give FB algorithm a **clear signal**.

The better option is to describe the value proposition in detail in your ad. Tell them it's a 45 minute webinar and access requires an email. This discourages low-quality clicks.

### 3 roles in FB ads

1. Strategy
2. Ad copy
3. Execution

High quality ideas and messaging are the most powerful tools.

Good ideas come from understanding deep desires and what matters to your prospects.

### Targeting

Don't target too narrow or it'll choke the algorithm.

Aim for 500,000 to 2mil audience.

Get good quality audience with:

- lookalike audience
- layered targeting

Use audience insights to discover possibilities.

Try 1% lookalike first. If it's going well, try 2% lookalike. If not performing, off it and try again next time.

### Optimization Event

You need to give FB enough data to optimize. 50 optimizing events a week is good.

FB algo can get stupid by giving you more and more low quality leads. The key is to correlate your ad to the person who will buy.

Another solution is to give a lower-priced product first.

### Take Facebook ad policy seriously.

Don't carelessly boost post.

Don't use 'you' or 'other people/diabetics/'. Write in 3rd person or a story about yourself.

Don't make sensational claims e.g. "make \$1k next month". Don't describe data. Hint at the emotional feelings of achieving the result.

Don't use profanity. Reduce use of emojis to replace words.

Avoid strange special characters.

Don't put anything your grandma or kid will be upset.

Don't show before after images.

Don't show too much skin.

Don't show a play button image that isn't clickable.

Landing page must have links to privacy policies and legal info.

Landing page mustn't contain auto-playing animations, audios.

Landing page mustn't have too many ads.

Avoid bitly.

Advertise 1 business for 1 ad account.

Don't use other people trademark. Avoid meme with images from a movie.

If your ad is rejected, appeal and edit until it gets approved.

If after couple of edits and still rejected, edit the ad to an inspirational quote and link to your homepage. After approved, never turn it back on.

### Transparency

Give Facebook the clearest signal to discourage low-quality clicks.

Ethical bribes with curiosity doesn't work well in FB because it generates more noise than signal.

Example of transparent ads: 'Land your dream job in 3 easy steps... in our one hour webinar'

Use FB creative hub to see placements. Write for mobile. Generate enough interest for people to click on 'see more'.

Example: As a busy mother...

### Ideas for ad

Theme is important. Answer this question: "my ad is about ... and that's important to my audience because ... "

The ad lead should capture prospect attention. Speak about their desire or fear. Use story, example or a way to see the world.

Best 2 hooks:

1. dialogue
2. question

**The 3 Lists:**

1. All the reasons people might benefit from your offer. Be specific ask 'why' many times.
2. Reasons people might not want to engage with your offer. E.g. don't want to give email.
3. Way someone might undermine the value you're giving. E.g. rely on opinions rather than data.

Creating many ads and see what sticks is wasting budget. Identify **one very specific** keyword phrase that's perfect for your business. Then write one great ad.

Long form ad (650 - 1000 words) works pre-qualify prospects. It can be repurposed into multiple ad creatives.

1. Start by asking a question. Use #1 in "The 3 Lists".

E.g. (fear) Ever woke up in the middle of the night wondering about this week's payroll?

2. Establish authority.

E.g. I've been thinking about this question a lot too. I've run an agency... and I can share a few ideas I've found valuable.

3. Share your 3-5 top insights generally.

4. Tell them what to do next clearly.

Write your ad within 30 minutes. Let it rest for a day and check:

- does it feel like a conversation?
- does it feel like your voice?
- What's the overall theme of your ad?
- What's the hook in the first 2 lines?

### Testing

Instead of creating an offer then creating ad copy to drive traffic to it, we reverse.

We test offer ideas with long form FB ads, see which people respond, then build an offer to it.

A large advertiser can create 5 ad sets, one theme for each. Each set has 5 different leads and 5 different hooks.

For smaller advertiser, create 2 themes. Create a generic landing page for people to sign-up to be notified. Every time someone signs-up, email/call them personally.

This is not A/B headline testing.

We should look at secondary metrics (clicks) and make judgement calls.

The 3 elements worst testing are:

1. copy intros
2. images
3. audiences

Put all variants in the same ad set.

Exclude your warm audiences.

Just use news feed.

Create an ad for each intro copy variant.

Keep headline and images same in all ads. Don't use image with text. These distracts people from your copy.

Calculate budget for minimum 500 impressions per ad variant. CPM (cost per 1k impressions) is around $30-$40.

Let's say we want 1000 impressions for each ad variant - to total to 5k impressions - that's $125 at $25 CPM.

Run ads for 3-4 days. Take weekend to spread out over weekdays and weekends.

Turn on ads in the morning so FB has more time to distribute.

Don't use dynamic creative for testing because you can't turn off individual ad to control.

Set automated rules to stop ads after getting your goal of impressions.

```
Create a rule:

Apply rule to: all active ads
Action: Turn off ads
Conditions: Lifetime impressions > 1500 & Ad name contains '[Test1500]'
Time range: lifetime
Schedule: continuosly
Rule name: Test 1500: Turn off ads at 1500 impressions
```

You can do mini-rounds of testing. Set up a rule to turn off ads of 750 impressions if ad name contains '[Test750]'. Wait till all ad reached 750 impressions, then change ad name to '[Test1500]'.

Why? FB is bias towards a winning ads. If you stop all ads and restart, you're giving FB a reset.

4 metrics to evaluate test results:

1. lowest CPC
2. highest CTR.
3. CTR (all). Multiple of 2-5 times of CTR.
4. purchases / leads. Because we don't have enough purchases to validate test.

Pick 3 ads that works best.

For image testing, pay attention to CTR (all) to CTR ratio.

To test audiences, choose ads that'll work. For a start, get 2 winning copy and 2 winning images - a total of 4 ads. Create an ad set for each audience to run 4 ads. Set daily budget to each ad set. No need automated rules, let the algo run 3 - 7 days to get 10 conversions per day.

For audience, look at conversion and cost per conversion. Ignore first 2 days of data because they are too erratic. If an audience is not getting our target CPA, turn it off.

## Metrics

### CTR

CTR: For cold traffics I want CTR of at least 1%. Less means you need to work on your ads.

Retargeting has high CTR for lower priced items and low CTR for high priced items.

A slipping CTR is a sign of ads fatigue before performance drop.

### CTR (all)

CTR (all) include clicks on comment, like, share and 'see more'.

For image ads: 2-5 times CTR
For video ads: 3-6 times CTR

A super high CTR (all) but low CTR shows your image or intro copy is incongruent with your body copy to drive clicks to your website.

If CTR (all) is 1.5 times CTR, people are clicking to your website before clicking 'see more.' Your leads may not be that qualified.

If an ad is already working, don't off it because of CTR (all) issues.

### CPM: Cost per mile aka cost to show to 1000 users

Low CPM is not always a good thing. FB sometimes show your ad to cheap audiences that has lower quality.

CPM correlates with CTR.

CPM rise with scale because low hanging fruits run out.

CPM may rise with regular posting in your FB page and seasonal trends. For new clients with low CPM (\$100) encourage them to post more organic contents.

### CPC (cost per link click)

CPC is a clearer picture of your ad performance.

You'll notice a steep drop in CPC before your campaign falls.

### Ad frequency

E.g. 2 freq over 7 days, one person see the ad 2 times a week.

If I have a group of ads with similar creative, look for ad frequency below 2. Above 2, performance falls.

## Custom conversions

Fire a pixel events when:

- someone is in our sales page over 10 seconds. `fbq('track', 'EngagedPageView')`
- add to cart

## Reporting

Create custom metrics e.g. landing page conversion = leads / landing page views

# 3 words exercise

Think 3 words you want people to associate you with, and 1 word you want people to know you're not.

# Cold emails

2020-08-03

1. Only one question. Asking zero question is ok.

An email to thank them for existing is okay.

2. Don't be too succinct.

Have personality and mention something memorable.

3. Tell about you and your credentials.

Have an email signature. Tell where you're from.

4. Switch to voice if mutual

Just ask "Let's talk"

5. Never ask if they'll mentor you

Follow-up. Persistence is being polite. Try different channels.
