# Internet scrapping

Here's a roadmap and budget for this project:

## Prototype phase

\$200 (deadline: 1 week)

- Scrape the first 50 questions in Airtable.
- I'll send you the scraped result in Excel.
- We can come up with filters and rerun the scraper until you're satisfied with the result.

Once you're happy with the scraped result, then we can implement this on your app.

## Implementation phase

\$1300 (2 weeks)

- Create a database to store these internet links.
- Enhance the scraper code to store results into database.
- Set up a scheduler to scrape and update database.
- Update chatbot code to use this database to provide article recommendations.

# 20 Oct 2020 billing

- 5 hours: Pop-up panel

- 2 hour: Create a fast path options to ‘jump to advice’ – can probably have the option listed under the same button as ‘restart’ – the flow can then continue on from the advice such as ‘would you like to explore root causes or expectations’

A button to jump to solution_1ae_loop. 'Question type' is dynamic.
Button placed under top-right restart.

- 0.5 hour: Remove 'how have you previously addressed this issue' in all flows.

- 2 hours audio

- 1.5 hours redesign welcome screen

## 4 Dec

- 1 hour: Update introduction slides and replace 2 images:
  - 2nd screen should be less formal and related to path or exploring.
  - 3rd screen image should be less formal business look, instead with more people
- 3 hours: Design and implement a prominent Elan chat bubble in the chat page.
- 12 hours: Amend flows for all question types to your slides. This is to improve the interactivity between the bot and shortens the time to get to the recommendations.
