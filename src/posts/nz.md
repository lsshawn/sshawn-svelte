# 2020-03-19 Wellington

Much livable city compared to Auckland. Perhaps my attachment with Busan previously?

Cuba street is overrated. Empty on a weekday evening. Lots of Malaysian restaurant.

Start fom Marahau, walk 50 kilometers to Totaranui, and from here took a water taxi back to Marahau.

# 2020-03-11 great walks - tent vs hut

For summer, always tent cos you'll save money and there's a risk of overbooked huts.

For winter, hut is not too expensive plus tents can get very cold.

# 2020-03-06 coromandel

Drive from east to west.

Pinnacle hike is a must do, compared to Cathedral Cove.

From Hahei, walk to see Cathedral Cove. 15 minutes walk on the beach to reach the start of the track. Track takes an hour. Don't park at someones driveway. Can snorkel.

Hot water beach is overrated. Just hot water coming out of the beach.
