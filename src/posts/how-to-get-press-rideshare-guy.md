1. Build relationship for future ask:
   - Give money. Offer to pay for food.
   - Get their phone number
   - Refer customers, help them out.
2. How to connect?
   - Write about them and how they influence you.
   - Leave a podcast or Amazon review and email them that you've left a review. You'll stand out more than 99% of the people.

Writing the pitch

Be casual.

Basic media strategy:

- Provide value to journalist on Twitter. E.g. social share.
- Do a weekly roundup of articles. At the end of month, tweet all those articles. A week later, let journalist know that we've shared their article.

Use Harrow to find journalist looking for help.

- Use media outlet as social proof.
- Add them on FB/Twitter and let them know you've replied to their request on Harrow.

Snowball effect: If you're busy to reply, point them to the right people.

Who to reach out for PR:

- See who else have covered your competitors.

When to start PR?

- Not necessary when getting started. But if something gets on your lap, take it.
