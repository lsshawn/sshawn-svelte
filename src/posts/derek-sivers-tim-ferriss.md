What you know doesn’t mean shit. It’s what you do consistently that makes the difference. It’s not about just more how to information, it’s about why to; incentives and much more than that.

The best plan is the one that lets you change your plans.

Not only do I not have morning rituals, but there’s really nothing that I do every day, except for eating or some form of writing, but here’s why. I get really, really, really into one thing at a time.

Don't be a donkey. Think long term. Realize that you can do one of these things for a few years and then do another one for a few years and then another.
