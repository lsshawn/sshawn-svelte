# Getting someone out of your league

- Treat them normally.
- Playful teasing. Don't compliment too much.
- Prioritize being honest above saying what they want to hear.
- Don't treat them like the only thing in your life. Have other things in your life other than your phone.
- Nervous is not a defect. Warm up socially by talking to other people.
- Don't look at social media
- Look and talk beyond fame, wealth or beauty.

# Craig flirting without being offensive

Teasing, absurdity, misinterpretation, innuendo.

1. Start in a fun positive way.
  - Use unique word in compliment (enchanting, sensational).
  - Higher energy than other people. Smile and talk louder.

2. Over the top teasing.
  - Ask an **absurd assumption**. (How long have you been in Al-Qaeda)
  - Callout when the person say something cliche that they won't feel insecure about. (How many girls say that). They'll try to justify they are different.
  - Tease yourself.
  - Playfully absurd.

3. Create a safe environment to flirt and be sexy.
  - Go first with a joke not about them.
  - Make it a no big deal.
  - Misinterpret. (Are we still talking about gardening?)

4. Innuendo: Say something innocent that can have a double meaning. Don't linger on them.

5. Flirt with everyone

6. Lean back when speaking
