# How to never be boring
:charisma:

# Finish other people's sentence with a joke

Be absurd.

Questions are opportunities to make people laugh.

> Q: Did you pee?
> A: I actually shit myself.

Start with a real answer, then exaggerate it.

# Say something nice, then make a guess

Start complementing or saying positive words.

Turn negatives to positives.

# Focus on having fun

Stop worrying about what other people think.
