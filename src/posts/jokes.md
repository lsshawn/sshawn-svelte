# After all that shit

Can't you believe that they're still together?

After all the shit they went through?

Your butt cheek.

# I let you down

A: What about the trip to Ikea? I felt I let you down.
B: No, that was years ago.

# Incredible

Incredible, as in not credible.

# Exorcised house

A: I had my house exorcised but I don't need to pay anything.
B: It's a good job because if you can't afford to pay, they'll come back and repossess the house.

# I'm not happy

A: I'm not happy
B: Which one of the dwarfs are you?

# Withdrawing

The US is pulling out from Baghdad. Fair enough, that's what you do after you fuck something.
