1. Become well known for one thing. Consider naming it and claiming it. Be niche. Diversified Solopreneur is better than Entrepreneur.
2. Educate people every single day. Show them your expertise through teaching. No motivational or hustle porn.
3. Create a small group of relevant people and interact every day to build familiarity.

## Profile
1. A catchy moniker: The Diversified Solopreneur.
2. What you’re working on: Building a portfolio of one-person businesses to $5M in revenue.
3. What people can expect when they follow you: Tweets and threads about audience & business growth.

## Day 1-30: Livestream your journey

AM1: Tweet a simple 4 or 5-step tip that’s easy to implement.
AM2: Tweet an easily consumable, and helpful listicle.
PM: Ask a great question that you’d like answered.

Use Hypefury to retweet all posts 9 hours later for double engagement and then untweet them 24 hours later to keep your feed clean.

## Day 30-60: Double down on your best

Find tweets that resonates and turn them into longer form threads.

## Day 61-90: Engage with relevant people daily
