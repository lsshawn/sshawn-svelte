Remember e-greeting card you used to receive in your email?

Dancing sheeps with a short note from your friend.

Wonder if those e-cards are still in your inbox?

It's so easy to text a heart. Sending a postcard takes more steps than putting an elephant in a fridge.

And that's why it matters.

# Slow down and write a postcard

Thought of an old friend? Send them a postcard.

Write to the grandma you stayed with in your last AirBnB. That'll make her day.

And to your loved ones...

Text history gets wiped off.

Your _xoxo_ are just a scroll away.

Why not write about how good looking they are and quietly throw the postcard into their bag.

It might take days for them to notice your note.

But they'll remember it for life.

_P.s. If you want to randomly receive postcards from me, [email me](mailto:l@sshawn.com) your address. I'll send you one in my next destination._
