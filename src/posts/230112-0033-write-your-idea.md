The real test is reading what you've written. You have to pretend to be a neutral reader who knows nothing of what's in your head, only what you wrote.

Ideas can feel complete. It's only when you try to put them into words that you discover they're not. So if you never subject your ideas to that test, you'll not only never have fully formed ideas, but also never realize it.
