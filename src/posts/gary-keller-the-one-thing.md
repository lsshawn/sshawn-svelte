## Think big, aim high

Warren Buffet said habits of our life are like chains too loose to be noticed until they're too tight to break. People accrue habits instead of form new ones.

If you don't choose the direction of your life, you'll go in any direction.

## Time blocking

Morning is your power hours. Do that one thing. The goal is to have a great day by noon. Then you're free to get distracted after noon. You only need to block 2-3 hours.

Ask yourself: What’s the one thing I can do such that by doing it everything is either easier or unnecessary?

Work is a rubber ball. If you drop it, it will bounce back. The other four balls—family, health, friends, integrity—are made of glass. If you drop one of these, it will be irrevocably scuffed, nicked, perhaps even shattered.

## Others

Document everything.

Gary uses month-at-a-glance to see where all his energy will be going in a month.

Plan time in months, even years in advance.

Can't make it to a speech, send a proxy. The proxy will say good things about you - making it more convincing.
