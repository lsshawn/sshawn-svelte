The first challenge of the essay was the asymmetrical difficulty in giving useful feedback. How can a teacher give 40 useful feedback in that short amount of time?

Students get more points for good typing and clear sentence structure than they did for actually thinking deeply, questioning the status quo or changing their minds.

And why do we even bothering to have kids write essays?

Switch to the Sal Khan model. Lectures at home, classes are for homework.

Challenge the students to actually discuss what theyâ€™ve read or learned. In real-time, teach them to not only create arguments but to get confident enough to refute them.

The opportunity going forward remains the same: Bringing insight and guts to interesting problems.
