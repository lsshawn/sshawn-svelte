A good content strategist will give you these before you start writing:

- 3 posts you want to outrank.
- terms
- outline

Put the 3 posts into an AI tool and it'll tell you statistically what Google expects to rank you higher.

To increase CTR:

- add % or number in title
- make a bold statement

Contrarian articles work in social, but is punished in Google.

Using ChatGPT:

- write your story first.
- then ask ChatGPT to rewrite it into a compelling stories.
- give 3 examples of compelling stories to ChatGPT
