# property authenticity

The chair you're sitting now.

Your phone that's identical to most of the people around you.

Who's to say they belong to you?

Even your house that you're in now. The only proof that you own the space is a paper that's kept with your landlord or government. A simple 'no' from them invalidates your ownership.

With a general ledger, aks proof-of-work that's public to all, you're no longer putting your ownership at risk of one person saying no.

# Blockchain is not a database

Blockchain is not for you to put data.

And database is a lot faster.
