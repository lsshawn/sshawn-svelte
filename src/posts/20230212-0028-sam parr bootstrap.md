Building a newsletter is still better than blog.

Cold email is the best.

Specific ask may not be the best. What catches his attention are emails like "You inspire me. Here's my result and I'll send you another email 30 days later to update my progress." Always follow up!

Set a hard goal. 1 year, 6 months, 3 months. What's your 5 years goal that you can hit in 6 months?

Increase your intensity.

Just learn ahead of people and write about what you're learning. Monetize through advertising. Sell.
