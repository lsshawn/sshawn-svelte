Write a bad version as fast as you can.

If you can't get started, tell someone what you plan to write about, then write down what you said.

Expect 80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it, and 50% of those you start with to be wrong.

Don't (always) make detailed outlines.

Use footnotes to contain digressions.

Try to tell the reader something new and useful.

Publish stuff online, because an audience makes you write more, and thus generate more ideas.
