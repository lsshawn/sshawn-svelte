Keep in mind that all of the above are plain, non-honorific forms of the sentences. Each of the sentences can be additionally expressed in both humble and honorific forms -- for example, 彼にあげる can be also phrased as 彼にやる or 彼に差し上げる. In addition to that, each of the sentences may also be expressed in polite form -- for example, 彼にあげる will turn into 彼にあげます. This makes a total of 6 (to list, (plain, polite) x (humble, regular, honorific)) ways of saying one thing!
