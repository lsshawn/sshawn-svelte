# One Circle Investor Memo

_Thereâ€™s a hole to fix._

---

> One circle is building **Heat pumps - a device that can cool and heat your home 3x more efficiently** - and the obvious next step in transition to electric and net zero emissions.

Demand & Market are proven, so is the tech - heat pumps are so reliable they have been used in the Buckingham palace for years.

## The **Numbers ðŸ“ˆ**

**1800 million Heat pumps needed by 2050 to reach Net Zero emissions. -** [International Energy Agency](https://www.ehpa.org/about/news/article/well-keep-the-lights-on/) - [EHPA](https://www.ehpa.org/about/news/article/well-keep-the-lights-on/)

Heat pump market to be worth **$140 billion by 2031**, up from $60 billion in 2020 - [FactMr](https://www.factmr.com/report/3763/heat-pump-market)

Heat Pump Market to Grow by **9% CAGR** as Energy Demand Increases in Residential Sector - [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-11-30/heat-pump-market-to-grow-by-9-cagr-as-energy-demand-increases-in-residential-sector)

[Sealed](http://sealed.com) - Startup helping people **install** heatpumps at no upfront costs, [350%](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220428005339/en/Sealed-Expands-Series-B-Funding-to-45.5M-as-It-Accelerates-Its-Mission-to-Stop-Home-Energy-Waste-and-Electrify-Homes-in-New-Major-Markets) annual growth.

Why now ?

**[Proven efficient technology](https://www.youtube.com/clip/Ugkx-GqFITT1m9dYIaVJWqZniYQDxP1ubpR7)** - Heatpumps **move heat in or out** instead of producing heat, making them 3x more efficient than traditional heating methods, **outputting more than 3 units of heat for every unit of electricity input**.

**The ideaâ€™s time has come** - Climate change is a looming threat, is strong increasing interest in heat pumps and there are shortages because supply canâ€™t meet the demand.

**Profitable Unit Economics** - Manufacturing costs around 3k-6k a unit depending on capacity. The layers in distribution and lack of transparency in the industry has installers today price gouging customers, [quoting](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxbDhF4gsvYT1bWVXWOkz0F2zVsGVvFXXoOfkgkOaMya8DGQ/viewanalytics) around $15k-30k for equipment and installation. Insane.

**Itâ€™s scalable** with big costs to entry and exit making the market perfect to stay in but hard to break into- Heat pumps arenâ€™t that hard to build, the company is.

Neither that hard to install.

Linus \*\*installing these units himself because -of course- he was quoted outrageous amounts for Heatpump installation.

Notes :

> _Complacent industry players, no innovation and layers upon layers in distribution. Dominated by the [fossil fuel industry](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=3690). Sound familiar?_

_This is basically the next EV market, but Heat pumps are much faster and easier to produce in massive numbers and can have a measurable impact on climate change quick._

---

How do we do this?

## **Go to market strategy â™Ÿ**

---

**Validating Demand -**

Pre-orders.

First step is to take pre-orders for Smart vents.

---

Company stages -

We jumped to build Heat pumps, but they have high development costs. So,we broke the company down into stages and products of increasing complexity, reducing time to launch while we build the next stage of the company.

Vents + Sensors + Thermostat - Design and Prototyping - Current

Window Air-conditioner + Heat pump.

Mini split Indoor + Outside Heat Pump unit.

As with most hardware startups, demand already exists, so weâ€™re focused on building. Not discounting the fact that talking to customers is super important - feedback has been super exciting to say the least.

---

**How do we fail?**

Competitors -

Midea , Mitsubishi and their North American partnerships in development are the biggest threats.

Manufacturing in Scale takes time and money, they have set operations.

Supply chain disruption.

Distribution - Building a large installers network and providing good customer service at scale is **[hard](https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/europes-booming-demand-for-heat-pumps-exposes-bottlenecks/)**, but doable.

However, these are big manufacturing companies are not in touch with the customer - more so with wholesalers and installers - middle-men who make the most money in this layered and not so transparent industry. Weâ€™re getting rid of as many layers as possible.

---

**How far are we?**

Currently prototyping our Smart climate control system.

Finishing up website and renders for pre-launch.

Will design crowdfunding campaign after feedback from pre-launch.
