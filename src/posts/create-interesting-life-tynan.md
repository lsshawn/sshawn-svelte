You only get one shot at life. Don’t waste your time copying someone else because you think it’ll make you happy.

## Trifecta of happiness

1. Work
2. Health
3. Relationship

Schedule what you love to do.

## Change doesn't have to be permanent.

Rent before buying your dream car.

## Pickup

Be different that the stereotypical guys that girls like.

Figure out what you're all about and share it with people in an engaging way.

Tell that you live in a RV if you do. Girls are into guys with things going on in their life.

Be proud of who you are. People love enthusiasm.

## How to permanently make your life better

Life will be the same unless you do something about it.

## Give out 5% of your income

Think how to have the most impact with that 5%.
