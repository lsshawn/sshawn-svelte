_"I want to learn French, so I need to attend classes"_

What is it that you wanted to say in French? Start with that sentence and then dissect its grammar. You'll learn faster that way.

_"I want be a programmer, so I need to take a 3 years degree"_

What is it that you wanted to build? Find a code reference to start writing. Google every syntax you couldn't understand.

Most ambitions - except flying and surgery - can begin right now. You don't need to approach it like our education system.

Stop putting off a project because you felt the need to read a book about it first.

Ask.

Create experiments to learn.

Heck, copy if you need to because [great artists steals](https://lifehacker.com/an-artist-explains-what-great-artists-steal-really-me-1818808264).
