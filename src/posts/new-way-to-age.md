The seven best doctors in the world are: God, sunlight, diet, rest, exercise, self-confidence, and friends.

Antiaging medicine builds up immune system. As a general rule people who practice antiaging medicine don’t get sick.

The foods we decide to consume and the choices we make each day can turn on certain genes or turn off certain genes.

We are actually in control of our fats, so you can override your genetic expression.

## 12 factors that contribute to diseases today:

- Nutritional imbalances
- Poor digestion and absorption
- Food intolerances Hormone and neurotransmitter imbalances
- Mitochondrial dysfunction
- Oxidative
- stress
- General stress reactions
- Electromagnetic stress
- Detox pathways
- Immune dysregulation and inflammation
- Environmental chemicals
- Genetic susceptibility

Eat organic food whenever possible.

## GI Tract

The GI tract is one of the most common problems to address: genetic modification of our food, the overuse of antibiotics and other medicines, antidepressants, antihistamines, they are all adversely affecting the microbiome, the bacterial balance of our gut.

We have a little pain, a little headache, people take ibuprofen or Aleve, not realizing all those medications also injure the protective lining of the GI tract.

**Epsom salt baths** are great to help reduce aches and pains. Take a little bit in water as a bicarb solution for gut issues.

## CBD

We use a lot of **CBD**. We just have to be cautious, because some CBD is derived from industrial hemp, and that can sometimes have some high levels of heavy metals.

You should ask wherever you’re buying it from for a certificate of authenticity, if possible, to show that it’s organic and doesn’t have any heavy metals. Also, for CBD to be most effective, it should have what we call natural-occurring terpenes.

Terpenes are what give certain plants their aroma, and they can have powerful health benefits. CBD can be used orally or topically to take the edge off. It’s good for sleep, depression, anxiety, and for pain. CBD is very safe and very effective.

**Bioidentical hormone** replacement probably makes the quickest and most dramatic change in people’s lives.

The number one complaint in any doctor’s office is fatigue, lack of energy, and part of that is frequently due to these mitochondria dying off as we get older, so we have to try to protect them. How do you protect them? Well, one way is by trying to minimize the exposure to various environmental chemicals because they disrupt and destroy mitochondria. The plastics we’re drinking out of: plastic bottles are a major problem with destroying mitochondrial function.

There’s nothing wrong with eating healthy fats: avocados, olive oil, almonds, walnuts, salmon, those are all healthy foods. The big factor in good health is eating real food. Use less canola oil, because there's no canola plant.

Far-infrared sauna is great for detoxifying.

Sufficient **niacinamide** would start to take away the pain of osteoarthritis within three to four weeks. There are no side effects unless we take more than our livers want to process, and then our livers will tell us by giving us a low-grade nausea, kind of like getting a little seasick;

If a person has a **large callus on their heels**, that’s a sign of vitamin A deficiency.

If a person takes enough vitamin A for a period of time, usually 50,000 units daily for an adult, which is quite safe unless you’re pregnant, that callus will usually be gone in about six months.

If we have **white spots on our nails**, that means we have zinc deficiency.

If you have **too much earwax**, your body needs to make more omega-3 fatty acids. So we counsel people to get the wax cleaned out and then start taking one and a half tablespoons of fish oil or cod liver oil twice a day.

## Grain fed cattle

Cows are born to eat grass, but then we started feeding them corn, which goes against their natural evolution and they develop things like E. coli infections.

It gives you meat with more omega-6 fatty acids, which are pro-inflammatory, so eating grain-fed cattle is not good for us.

## Cow milk

The Harvard study of 28,000 male physicians showed that the more milk men drank, the more prostate cancer they got.

Did nature and creation intend for people to drink the milk of another species?

Think about this: When a little calf is born, it’s not so little, is it? It can walk right away, and it has a tiny brain, whereas when a little human is born, it can’t walk until it’s over a year old, and it’s got a big brain, so obviously, the composition of the milk for each species is the milk that belongs in that species, and if we deviate from that, some of us are going to get in trouble.

If you’ve ever had a **strep throat**, you are a milk-allergic person.

Human bodies have energies that vibrate at certain frequencies.

I take **melatonin** nightly because it promotes sleep but also for its antioxidant effects.

**Hair is determined by stomach acid.** For ladies it’s sometimes easier, because the older we all get, the less well we digest. It’s not just our hormones that go down with age, but the stomach acid declines with age, the pancreatic enzymes decline with age.

Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is one of many things that decline with age.

Take the **Heidelberg test**. The report told us that by the time we’re in our sixties, we have a fifty percent chance—women 58.8 percent, men 50.1 percent—of declining stomach acid.

When a premenopausal woman comes to my clinic and I notice she’s losing her hair and/or her nails are going bad, I always recommend a **stomach acid test**.

Everybody with rosacea has low stomach acid.

## Curaderm

Curaderm is an incredible cream for skin cancer.

Curaderm is made from eggplant.

Cows would rub their eyes against this particular plant and the cancer would go away.

They contained molecules that can only enter into cancer cells.

The person puts a little bit of this Curaderm cream—which, remember, can only get into cancer cells, it cannot get into normal cells—they put a little bit on there and put a Band-Aid over it and, twelve hours later, applied more and put a Band-Aid over it, and they kept doing that every twelve hours, and you can see in that book, it goes from looking like a cancer that was a big hole in the face back to looking normal, and it took twelve to fourteen weeks.

## Stress

Worry is a prayer for what you don’t want. I use his quote daily as one of my tools to dismiss negatives the moment a worrisome thought comes into my mind,

One of several things you can do to control your stress is to eliminate artificial chemicals.

Focus is what separates peak performers from average performers, which is why so many high-profile leaders practice meditation.

I am enough. Acceptance reduces stress.

Did you know that the largest amount of chemicals to which your internal organs are exposed comes from your food? It’s said that 30 to 50 percent of your food each day should be raw; simple

Very bad diets with no fresh organic fruits and vegetables, filled with fried high-calorie food, low-fiber food, and grilled meats may do more damage to you than even smoking.

Periodic detoxing is now essential.

## Chapter 4: Supplementation

I have my supplemental protocol determined by blood testing that indicates my deficiencies.

If you’re not thrilled with your daily performance, it’s time to take supplementation seriously.

B12 deficiency can cause depression and even in certain cases bipolar-1 disorder (manic depressive illness) and more commonly bipolar-2 disorder.

When taking B12, be sure to take folic acid along with it, as both are needed for methylation.I A deficiency of either can produce anemia, so always correct both if you are deficient.

### GLUTATHIONE

The liver makes glutathione, but our reserves run out earlier and earlier in today’s world.

### MAGNESIUM

Small amounts of magnesium lowered the risk of heart disease.

Low magnesium can magnify free radical damage and precipitate the production of free radicals. Free radicals are the “bad guys.”

Following symptoms could indicate that you have a magnesium deficiency. Low energy. Muscle twitching or cramping. Difficulty sleeping.

### CURCUMIN

If you are going to take only one supplement for the rest of your life, make sure it’s a multivitamin with meaningful potencies.

Two-Per-Day provides higher potencies of vitamins, minerals, and plant extracts than are found in other supplements.

### Zinc

Zinc is best absorbed in the zinc picolinate form at a minimum of 30 milligrams daily, along with a bit of copper.

Zinc is also a prostate protector; the recommended dose is 60 milligrams zinc (with copper) daily.

### PREBIOTICS AND PROBIOTICS

If I had to choose only one supplement to take for the rest of my life, it would be probiotics. Most cutting-edge doctors suggest starting with a good probiotic; if you don’t see results in three weeks, consider adding a low-cost prebiotic supplement

### Calcium

Calcium turns things on, and magnesium turns things off.

It’s important to take vitamin K along with calcium.

Calcium is an essential mineral, but it tends to want to go to the soft tissues (arteries), where it can cause harmful calcium deposits on the heart valves (aortic stenosis) and in the arteries (arteriosclerosis). Vitamin K acts like a traffic cop, rerouting the calcium to go to the bones, where it is needed,

At home, use HEPA filters to clean your air.

Switch out all chemical home cleaning products to natural nontoxic ones

Stop eating artificial sweeteners and MSG, stop eating soy products (soybeans are now mostly genetically modified (GMO),

GMOs, you’ll get a wake-up if you google Genetic Roulette.

It’s important to stop eating “plastic” fats (as I’ve described earlier) and partially hydrogenated oils. Also, get house filters for your tap water so you can eliminate chlorine, fluoride, and other compounds from it.

Next time you are out, notice how many people, especially older people, have watery, bloodshot, sick-looking eyes. Could it be toxic buildup?

IV drips are commonly used, as is far-infrared sauna, which helps you sweat out the toxins. Make sure to wipe down in the sauna regularly so as not to reabsorb the toxins you just excreted. Also, take extra magnesium when you detoxify.

Today’s crops contain only a fraction as much (80 percent less) of the humic substances (especially fulvic acid) as they did a century ago,

## Interview with Julie Carmen

find one posture or sequence they love, that they know will work, and just do it throughout the day. That way we are not chasing stress but we are ahead of it.

“Keeping my heart rate and breath steady even as I increase the intensity of my physical practice.”

## Chapter 6: No One Size Fits All

Bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) twenty-five years ago, a decision that changed the course of my life. As a result, I don’t have any of the negative symptoms of aging, I sleep eight hours without drugs, my weight is good, my libido is good, my skin is not very wrinkled for my chronological age.

ReMIND supplementation for the brain. I take six a day. I also take over-the-counter lithium, 20 milligrams daily, and two capsules of turmeric, along with what I use liberally in cooking.

By analyzing your lab work, your doctor will individualize your treatment, that is, prescribe the exact right amount of hormones for you and your deficiencies.

Succumbing to the diseases of aging. Bioidentical hormones can be taken orally or by hormone cream.

## Chapter 7: How Hormones Work

There are major and minor hormones. The majors include insulin, thyroid hormone, adrenaline, and cortisol. If any of these is too high or too low, you won’t live very long.

The minor hormones (although why they are called minor I’ll never understand, because when they are low, you feel awful) include estrogen, progesterone,

## Interview with Dr. Jonathan Wright

Lungs are estrogen dependent.

If a woman is an athlete and in menopause, if she wants to maintain her lung function in order to continue her athletic abilities, estrogen will help her maintain her lung function.

To get hormone replacement right, the ratios are most important in achieving healthy hormonal balance. Urine testing is crucial to achieving correct balance and ratios—and of course, listening to the patient.

Forget about blood testing because you can’t get the free fraction of two of the three major estrogens, including the anticarcinogenic one—estriol—measured in a blood test.

Iodine as a preventative for breast cancer. If breast cancer cells start to form, if iodine is present in that same breast tissue, the iodine combines with a particular fat that’s in the breast cancer and kills the breast cancer.

“Kills breast cancer cells”? Yes, he did. Also, iodine, as well as iodide, causes the body to make much more of the anticancer hormone estrogen, called estriol.

“A drop a day keeps breast cancer away.” It’s very important it be a drop of Lugol’s solution, which requires a prescription for full strength. Full-strength Lugol’s can’t be sold online because of the DEA. She puts one drop on this breast over here today and one drop on that breast over there tomorrow. By doing this she cuts her risk of breast cancer dramatically because you already have the iodine ready and waiting inside your body for when (or if) breast cancer cells show up.

So the point is, ladies, if you happen to have an autoimmune disease—and women get it six times as much as the men—get your natural medicine doctor to try HCG.

## Chapter 8: Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone (TRH)

Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). For lack of a better explanation, it “wakes up” a lazy brain

Thyroid regulates the metabolism of the body, which is why low thyroid hormone levels frequently lead to symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and constipation.

Dr. Wright recommends blood evaluation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) while on TRH. The expected result of TRH stimulation is an increase in TSH.

For me TRH was that miracle; after three months of taking it, my sleep pattern normalized, my hair grew back stronger, my nails became strong again, and my symptoms of low thyroid dissipated.

I order my TRH, called Abaris, from International Aging Systems;

## More from Dr. Jonathan Wright

Why do so many people have thyroid problems? WRIGHT: Some Americans don’t have enough iodine and iodide in their diets. The populations that have enough iodine or iodide in their diets are those who eat seafood regularly; the closer you get to the coast, the more iodine you’re going to get in your diet. Unfortunately, you don’t get much iodine from freshwater fish.

Another thyroid disrupter, a big, bad one, is fluoride. Fluoridation does more harm than it ever did good.

Fluoride will get into the thyroid and take the place of the iodide that should be there, so the thyroid gland simply can’t work correctly or optimally; impossible with all that fluoride in there.

To make sure how much “free” hormone is available to fit into the lock, we have to measure our free T3, and our free T4.

So now we can supplement with TRH, which stimulates the TSH, and that stimulates the thyroid gland, but doctors who rely strictly on TSH testing are going to tell people, “Well, look at that, your TSH is low, that must mean your free T3 and free T4 are enough for you.” Excuse me; it often means your hypothalamus is malfunctioning. It’s crucial to look at all those hormones—free T4, free T3, TSH, all three—because if that TSH is low, and the T4 is high or high normal, then as a doctor you’d expect the TSH to be low. But if both the free T4 and the TSH are low, that usually means enough TRH isn’t being made by the hypothalamus to stimulate the T4 and free T4.

Those of us who have been replacing hormones naturally are healthier.

## Chapter 9: The Hormone System: The Juice of Youth

The majors are insulin, thyroid hormone, adrenaline, and cortisol. The minors are the best known: estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, DHEA, and pregnenolone. When the minor hormones fall or decline, you get the symptoms associated with menopause:

Nothing personal. Some women don’t want to reinstate their period when they go on bioidentical hormone replacement, but beware;

Dihydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is abundantly produced in healthy young adults, but the level declines dramatically as we age. DHEA is made by the adrenal glands and converted into testosterone and estrogen. DHEA is involved in critical body functions: mood, sexual desire, bone density, weight.

One of the things older people are often warned about is not to fall, because aging brings about brittle, frail bones, so keeping DHEA at healthy levels is vitally important.

Without enough pregnenolone, you are sure to have memory problems

Pregnenolone is available over the counter.

Cancer patients with low cortisol have little ability to fight the cancer, which increases the chances that the cancer

96 percent of women who had taken melatonin in that study reported a total disappearance of morning depression,

## Interview with Dr. Thierry Hertoghe

Add thymosin alpha-1 to my “three-shot” to keep my immune system strong.

Her face took longer to react because she kept eating grains, which counters the beneficial effects of a hormone treatment.

So if you’re a vegan, you should certainly add all the vitamins you are lacking because of your diet. This includes all the fat-soluble vitamins, vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin K. (Vegans also cannot make vitamin D very easily, because they don’t have

Amino acids are what makes your body tight, what makes your skin firm. When you look at a person, mostly what you see, his or her appearance, is the effect of amino acids—the skin, the muscles. Not the brain, which is mostly made of fat.

When you see very old people who lose their muscles, a great part of the loss is
Studies show that eating a paleo diet that includes only or mostly organic foods decreases the toxic load. Just by doing that your hormones are already getting better.

Peptide sex shot; PT 141. In healthy aging medicine, the new big improvements in rejuvenation are peptides, which are smaller proteins that the organs of our body produce for their local use to keep working well. For instance, muscles make peptides for the muscles, the liver makes peptides for the liver, and

Each peptide only works for that organ, and each peptide is specific to that organ.

Imbalance of hormones makes you age quicker. It’s unsafe to have high cortisol when you have low anabolic hormones. If your cortisol is excessively high, the way to lower it is to take supplements of hormones that decrease cortisol, such as growth hormone, oxytocin [the “love and sex” hormone], anabolic hormones, and thyroid hormones.

SOMERS: We didn’t talk much about oxytocin; my husband and I take three sniffs at night and our dreams are always pleasant. I’m in a happy mood most all the time.

## Interview with Dr. Abraham Morgentaler

Testosterone as the antidote to prostate cancer.

Every cell in our body requires protein, fat, and carbohydrate. Without fat our cells lose one of their essential building blocks. I am happily eating butter again!

If you are losing testosterone, your prostate’s going to enlarge, looking for essential ingredients—like making a cake but not having any eggs.

Think of a houseplant as prostate cancer and water as testosterone. If you deprive the plant of water, it will shrink, it will lose its volume. If the water-deprived plant is given water, it

However, one action of DHT that guys don’t like is that in the scalp it contributes to male-pattern baldness. Medicines that block DHT, like Propecia, help to prevent hair loss in men and in women and may even promote new hair growth.

When men have low testosterone, they lose muscle and gain fat.

## Chapter 11: The Devastating Effects of Toxicity on Aging

You can reduce your chances of getting serious illnesses by balancing your hormones, metabolizing them properly, keeping your vitamin D levels high enough, and supplementing with nutrients in which you are deficient.

Documented adverse health effects. Americans today ingest far too many omega-6 fats (such as soybean and corn oils), which deprive cell membranes of healthy amounts of omega-3 fatty acids.

Since all of the brain and nervous system, the liver, and every cell membrane are made of fat, you need to eat lots of good fat to keep making good cells.

Eating more good fats and stopping eating all “plastic fats” will help you achieve a normal weight.

Exposure to them. Let’s start with food. Organic food is not negotiable. Most of us got sick from the processed, pesticide-sprayed food

### PHTHALATES

Phthalates, chemicals produced by plastic bottles

Women with high levels of phthalates in their system during pregnancy were found to have sons that had feminine characteristics.

## Interview with Dr. Jonathan Wright

If you have a deficiency of cortisol, then the blood sugar might go too low. I read a paper written by a neurologist years ago that pointed out that when sugar goes too low in the middle of the night, we wake up.

One of the ways of dealing with waking up at three a.m. is eating protein at bedtime, because when there’s not enough sugar around, our body will take some of the amino acids from protein and turn them into sugar.

If you can’t sleep: Have the Kraft Prediabetes Profile done to find out if your blood sugar level is low. If so, then check your cortisol level to see if that is too low also. By adjusting and balancing these two levels, your sleep should return to normal.

Men like chasing the ladies, and they can do that better if they have higher levels of nitric oxide. The drug Viagra raises your nitric oxide levels by stopping the breakdown of nitric oxide, which helps dilate blood vessels everywhere, including that key place for guys. Japanese research found that infrared penetrates right to the blood vessels and induces the formation of more nitric oxide, so when I tell guys about that, they’re on their way to the infrared sauna store.

So far-infrared sauna makes for better erections?

But when I started taking Carditone, a natural supplement, my BP lowered to a lovely 116 over 80. Thanks.

There is good news and bad news: most women tolerate it perfectly. I have run into some men, when they take Carditone, and, oops, things no longer work as well in the bedroom. For a guy to get aroused, he has to have a little bit of adrenaline happening there, but if his adrenaline is depleted, he can’t get as excited. So guys need to know about that, but that’s not every guy, and most guys with high blood pressure can use it and not get into trouble.

One of the things about Carditone is it is possible to overdose and drive one’s blood pressure down too low.

It’s good to order nitric oxide test strips from the drugstore. Those are little strips of plastic with a little patch of sensitive material on the end. On the tube there is a color code which will give you an indicator of your nitric oxide levels.

Why do we want to do that? Because nitric oxide dilates blood vessels, and when we dilate blood vessels, guess what? Our blood pressure comes down. This allows you to check yourself: Is my body making an optimal amount of nitric oxide? If you aren’t making enough nitric oxide, then take food into consideration; beets are number one, and spinach is number two.

## THE TEN BEST FOODS TO INCREASE NITRIC OXIDE PRODUCTION Arugula (rocket)

1.Rhubarb 2. Garlic is a known sexual health aid and one of the most beneficial herbs. 3. Dark chocolate is known to support heart health. 4. Watermelon contains citrulline, an amino acid that changes to arginine, which is a nitric oxide precursor. 5. Swiss chard 6. Beetroots 7. Pomegranate boosts nitric oxide and is a tremendous anti-inflammatory. 8. Celery contains nitric oxide precursors. However, the amount can differ depending on where it is grown 10. Shrimp

It comes out bright pink, or some people need to take a supplement, and there’s a supplement out there called L-citrulline; anywhere from 1 gram to 3 grams a day, sure enough, that test strip is going to turn bright pink.

Recommend that people start with the food, and then you test yourself once. Then let’s say you start eating a lot of beets,

These days, it’s much more important than ever. Fish oil contains omega-3 fatty acids, which are anti-inflammatory. Fish oil helps control inflammation all through the body; it also happens to help to improve the population of brain cells in the memory area of the brain, and we can all use having our memory cells improved. Fish oil is a huge help and a very good idea.

Over-the-counter lithium is amazing for memory.

Taurine is an amino acid which does not participate in the formation of protein at all; it’s an electricity regulator in the brain and heart. For example, it helps to control seizures in small children. But it also helps with heart rhythm disturbances. But let’s get to what it really helps with: new brain cells!

Taurine helps you to lose weight!

## Chapter 12: The Gut

All disease starts in the gut.—Hippocrates, the Father of Medicine

The powerful antidote for most reflux recommended by allopathic doctors is proton pump inhibitors,

Long-term use of these types of powerful acid-suppressing drugs has been potentially linked to significant problems, including kidney disease, bone fractures, low magnesium levels, diarrhea, vitamin B12 deficiency, and even dementia!1 Many of you have the condition because you don’t make enough stomach acid, and now your doctor gives you a drug to take away even more acid.

Heartburn is a result of the sphincter muscle between the esophagus and stomach not closing all the way.

Add to this not enough digestive enzymes and hydrochloric acid, and you set the stage for chronic digestive issues.

Factors that worsen and intensify heartburn or GERD include: Heavy meals Excess alcohol consumption Excess caffeine consumption Obesity Eating two to three hours before bedtime Hiatal hernia

If you’ve had radiation therapy to your chest, as I did for breast cancer, it inhibits your body’s ability to make sufficient hydrochloric acid for life!

Antidepressants. These drugs are a temporary Band-Aid but have been shown to increase the frequency of depression when taken long term. Now your sexual performance diminishes,

Remember: “anti”-biotic takes away, “pro”-biotic puts back.

Increase your PPI intake, you increase your risk of C. difficile infection.

## Chapter 13: Dispelling Myths About Heart Health

In reality, healthy fat is essential for your body. Without fat in the diet, cognition diminishes.

Cholesterol is found at the scene of the crime, but it’s not the perpetrator.

The dietary guidelines led food manufacturers to replace animal fats with processed vegetable fats. The labels on foods containing them say “low fat” and “heart healthy.” But they’re not healthy at all, just the opposite: they’re disease makers!

But because of the dietary guidelines that called for reducing the consumption of animal fat, McDonald’s gradually phased out the beef tallow and replaced it with processed

except that it was no laughing matter. Statin drugs can damage muscles and even weaken your heart because they block an essential heart nutrient called coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). Today we know better. Refined vegetable (omega-6) fats and sugars are primary culprits.

Clearly, nature wanted us to have a high-fat diet.

## Interview with Dr. Stephen Sinatra

Many cases of heart disease often originate from deep hurts and disappointments that we all experience in childhood.

There’s no question that when women hit menopause, their incidence of coronary disease goes up as much as four times.3 That’s a significant statistic. Women are protected by estrogen in their premenopausal days

If a woman becomes more like a man, such as a corporate executive in the workplace—performing, being the breadwinner—and at the same time, she continues her female roles—nurturing her children, taking care of parents, cooking, maybe driving the kids to school, appointments, and all of that—she’s literally working like a dog.

HDL stands for “high-density lipoprotein.” Newer research shows that an HDL blood level of 40 to 60 milligrams per deciliter is ideal.

After being dubbed the “good cholesterol” for so many years, we now realize that too much HDL can be dysfunctional: it fires the inflammation I believe to be the real cause of heart disease.

If you’ve had blood-related family members die young and suddenly from heart disease, then it’s a good idea to get that EBCT scan. Should EBCT results show calcification in a young male, I would pull out the prescription pad and employ a statin for its profound anti-inflammatory and blood-thinning properties, not to target cholesterol.

You need cholesterol in the brain: it’s vital for the brain. And cholesterol also makes sex hormones. Some men become impotent on statin drugs.

Cholesterol has been vilified—which is so wrong—that we ignore everything it does right. Cholesterol actually protects our health, and I truly feel the most vital aspect of cholesterol is the support of proper brain function.

Omega-3 essential fatty acids do a lot for the brain and a lot for the heart. Certainly, coenzyme Q10 is vital for the heart

If you are over the age of fifty, take 100 to 200 milligrams daily. CoQ10 is best taken after meals over the course of the day in divided doses. If you’re compromised with heart disease and/or high blood pressure, then more, perhaps up to 200 to 300 milligrams daily.

The sine qua non of aging—or accelerated aging—is leaky membranes. You’re familiar with leaky gut. So if you have leaky brain membranes, where vital nutrients can’t get in and toxins can’t get out, there’s a problem.

Uncontaminated squid oils for the brain, like docosahexaenoic acid

Take astaxanthin supplementation for eye health.

I always tell people, both men and women, if you have even the slightest suspicion you may be having a heart attack, then chew on an aspirin, call 911, and get to an emergency room or walk-in medical center for evaluation.

SINATRA: No, just be sure you have it in your medicine cabinet. And check the expiration date

He said he believed his results had to do with the fact that he grounded himself all the time; he slept grounded, and he walked barefoot whenever possible.

If grounding while you sleep, for example, can lower your sympathetic activation by enhancing SNS discharge, it promotes balance of the ANS. It’s like recharging your body for free.

Offers a holy trinity: the perfect trifecta! When you connect to the earth, you lower blood pressure, thin

Ever since I started sleeping on a grounding sheet, taking Carditone supplementation, and utilizing EECP, I sleep better, more soundly, no more backaches, and best of all, my blood pressure is normalized.

## Chapter 14: Enhanced External Counterpulsation (EECP)

An alternative to blood pressure meds and a slew of pharmaceuticals, including dangerous statins? Wait until you read about enhanced

EECP works by squeezing blood from the legs upward to the heart while the heart is at rest. You lie on a padded therapy table outfitted with large blood pressure measurement–like cuffs

## Chapter 15: The Heart and the Jaw

Jaw could be a factor in heart disease and stroke?

Many NFL and NBA players wear jaw protection appliances during games to protect themselves from misalignment, balance, and strength issues as well as concussions.

## Interview with Dr. Leonard Feld

The nerves that are attached to the head of the jaw with the blood vessels go directly to the brain, and when they are jammed the brain is short-circuited, like a fuse blowout or a dead battery: “Lights out.”

With a jaw that pops, the cartilage slowly wears out and there’s grinding and louder popping. Then all of a sudden the popping, grinding stops. SOMERS: Why? FELD: Because you’ve gone through the cartilage. You’ve worn it out. And now you’re bone on bone. It starts impinging on nerves, and you get headaches, migraines. So how does this happen? Because the jaw is out of alignment, and that affects blood flow to the brain.

Atrial fibrillation, or afib, is a heart rhythm disorder in which the upper heart chambers contract irregularly. Afib ups a person’s risk of stroke by a factor of five. Research links afib to sleep apnea, and there is a strong correlation between obstructive [jaw in the way] sleep apnea, where breathing stops while you are sleeping,

The best preventative treatment is to maintain an open airway during sleep.

The mouthpieces we make for the football players and the basketball players are nothing more than to keep the jaw forward, so they can breathe through their nose.

## Chapter 16: NAD+ and Senolytics

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), “the closest we’ve gotten to a fountain of youth.”

If you have healthy young cells, you have a healthy young body.

The name of this cell-cleansing process is autophagy, and it can now be naturally “turned on” to remove cellular debris

Interview with Bill Faloon

Arthritic joints are laden with senescent cells that generate so much destructive inflammation that cartilage is destroyed and natural regenerative factors suppressed. So when we clear senescent (“broken”) cells from joint linings, the inflammation ceases and natural cartilage regeneration can rapidly occur.

In the proof-of-concept studies we helped fund, there was evidence of significant clearance of senescent cells using just two doses of a drug called dasatinib along with high-dose quercetin.

A compound found in black tea called theaflavins possesses many of the same senolytic properties as dasatinib.

A nutritional formula comprising black tea theaflavins combined with a highly absorbable quercetin phytosome. The dosage recommendation is just once a week,

Fisetin, found in many fruits and vegetables.

The most popular supplement our readers use to boost their NAD+ levels is an NAD+ precursor combined with resveratrol.

“[NAD+ is] one of the most important molecules for life to exist, and without it you’re dead in 30 seconds.”8 NAD stands for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.

But there are other factors that can cause NAD+ to plummet, such as excess alcohol ingestion and eating unhealthy foods that require extensive liver detoxification.

If you are under age fifty, you can use a natural NAD+ precursor like nicotinamide riboside, which is a dietary supplement. The dose for most people is 250 to 500 milligrams a day. If you are over age fifty, then you may need to boost your NAD+ to youthful ranges by having a physician administer NAD+ infusions or prescribe patches that deliver NAD+ through your skin into your bloodstream.

How do we clear this cellular debris?

The drug, rapamycin, does its job in about thirty-six to forty-eight hours and then is mostly metabolized out of the body, so side effects typically do not occur.

But at this stage, we are finding most of our supporters may not need rapamycin because they are achieving similar benefits by taking the antidiabetic drug metformin or by using dietary supplements that work via similar pathways as metformin, such as gynostemma leaf extract and hesperidin, or practicing calorie restriction or intermittent fasting.

## Chapter 17: Telomere Lengthening

Reversing cellular aging by lengthening the telomeres; for lack of a better description, the telomeres are “tails” on the end of each

I have been taking telomere supplementation in the form of TA-65 for nine years. I must say, I believe it’s working. My skin is not wrinkling much. I have no “sloppy skin,” especially considering my age. The skin on my face is minimally wrinkled. However, TA-65 is not promoted as a cosmetic product; the goal of using it is to rejuvenate cells inside our bodies.

The accepted way in which scientists calculate biological age is to measure telomere length through blood testing by a qualified doctor.

## Chapter 18: Stem Cells: The Future or Now?

The number of stem cells in our body declines drastically with age.

There are three sources of autologous adult stem cells in humans: bone marrow, which involves extracting stem cells from pelvic bone; adipose tissue (fat cells), which involves harvesting stem cells using liposuction (this was the procedure I chose for my breast regrowth); and blood, which involves drawing blood and then harvesting stem cells through a process called apheresis.

## Interview with Dr. Dipnarine Maharaj

Stem cells form the immune system of the body—that’s one of the main functions of our stem cells. In a baby, these stem cells have not matured enough to form a fully functional immune system.

So injecting stem cells from a baby could be harmful to somebody if it’s not the right “fit” or tissue type.

The safest thing is to bank your own stem cells for future use from birth and beyond. I did this fifteen years ago.

## HOW TO MAINTAIN A STRONG IMMUNE SYSTEM

Get enough sleep.

Get regular exercise, the right amount but not too much. Superathletes who overexercise have a shorter life span because their immune systems are weakened.

The real way to deal with that epidemic is actually to prevent it. One of the main ways of prevention and preserving our immune system is by banking our stem cells for the future.

The way to prevent cancer is to make sure all of our natural killer cell numbers are high and functioning well.

## Interview with Dr. Marc Darrow

Most areas of the body can be repaired without surgery, and most important for your readers to know about, Suzanne, is that we can no longer trust imaging to tell us where pain is being generated.

But I always tell my patients, if you go to a barber, you get a haircut. If you go to a surgeon, you get a surgery.

I believe anesthetic kills brain cells.

Never have a knee, shoulder, or hip injected without ultrasound guidance.

## Interview with Dr. Jonathan M. Fishbein

The first thing one should look for is a high-quality CBD product that does not include THC.

## Interview with Dr. Michael Galitzer

I’ve started taking my 20 milligrams of cortisol all in the morning, rather than spreading it out throughout the day, and I have so much more energy.

Everybody with cancer has weak adrenals, and you need to know that chemo kills cancer cells but all that chemical debris has to be cleared by the liver, so supporting the liver is crucial for survival.

Take telomere-lengthening supplements such as TA-65 to renew cell strength, take NAD+ precursors to help repair DNA breaks, try EECP to lower your blood pressure.

## Appendix A: Blood Testing

For aging men, testing for testosterone and estrogen can provide a basis to optimize these hormones
HLA-DR Mold Genetic Testing The HLA-DR genetic test provides information on genetic susceptibility to an overactive immune response to environmental toxins, chemicals, and mold.

Toxic Metals Panel (Fecal) This at-home test assesses your environmental and dietary exposure to toxic metals. This test is best combined with a heavy metals blood test for a more complete picture of the body’s detoxification process.
