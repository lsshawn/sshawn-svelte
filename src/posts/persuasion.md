# Persuasion

# Consider alternatives

Have a bottom price to walk away.

# Use question to dig out information

Ask to dig other party's incentives and goals. Don't assume your assumptions are correct.

Interrogate indirectly while sounding sufficiently informed.

# Don't start too narrow and not maximizing value

Don't fix on just the price. Bring in the other extra value you can bring in.

Normal negotiator focus on a fixed pie. Genius negotiator enlarge the pie.

Introduce as many **talking points** to maximize value.

If the other party values something more than you do, don't just give it. Sell it.

The goal isn't to reach win-win. It's to maximize value by identifying your interest and other person's interests. Ask if you don't know.

# Recognize emotional and cognitive bias

Appeal to what they're going to lose is more appealing that what they'll gain.

Tell bad news in one go.

Tell good news in drips.

Door in the face: Start with a large ask, then moderate it down to something reasonable.

Foot in the door: Build relationship before ask.

# How to negotiate from a weak position

Don't advertise your weak position. Don't show you're time or cash constrained.

Divert your weakness to theirs.

# Steel-Manning

Steel-manning is to create the strongest argument to disagree on.

The opposite is 'straw-manning' which is to create the weakest version of their argument and knock it over.
