# Buying Companies

# Motivation

Look for founders who are selling because of non-financial motive like retirement and burnout.

In your follow-up email:
- establish their reason to sell
- "I'm serious and have ready money to acquire."

# Earn-out payment

To reduce customer leaving because of relationship with business owner.

Pay cash upfront and balance as percentage of sales for 6-18 months.
