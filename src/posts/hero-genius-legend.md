Genius is not about your genetics. Genius is about habits.

> My dominant commitment is to work towards a 6 figure SaaS.

With better awareness, you make better choices.

Don't be addicted to distractions - your mobile. It's the death of your production.

Addiction to entertainment will deny you world class.

## 3 stages of habit installation

It takes 66 days to wire a new habit.

1. Destruction. You're recoding your brain.
2. Confusion. You're confused because you're growing. Embrace the messiness.
3. Integration. It's getting easier now.

You only need willpower during this 66 days. After that, your willpower is freed for the next ritual.

## Routines

1. Wake up at 5am. You give yourself 3 pristine hours to do the 20-20-20 formula:
1. 20 minutes of movement. Sweating in the morning will repair brain cells damaged from stress and gives you energy.
1. 20 minutes of writing in a journal.
1. 20 minutes of learning. Listen to a podcast, read, or review notes.
1. 90-90-1 rule. For the next 90 days, spend your first 90 minutes at work focusing on your single, biggest opportunity that moves the needle in your industry.
1. Second wind workout at the end of your day.
1. Spend 60 minutes every day to know more about your industry. Be relentless to learn and be curious.

## Morning declaration

Write 3 paragraphs of your code of conduct. Read this everyday in the morning.

## Maxims

1. Run your own race.
2. Success is masterful consistency around the fundamentals.
3. Inner empires realize outer empires. Work on your mind, physical and emotional first.
4. Discomfort is the price of world class. Passion is suffering.
5. Be so amazing you don't need introduction.
