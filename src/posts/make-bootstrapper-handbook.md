# Make: Bootstrapper's Handbook - levelsio

Grow organically. You don't need ads.

# Ideas

Solve your own problem because often they are niche.

Don't focus on earth-shattering ideas, e.g. VR.

Ideas are just a multiplier of execution.

Share your ideas to get your brain outside of its comfort zone to evolve the idea.

Don't start something you're not passionate.

Start from the problem, not solution.

# Building

An MVP should function and not be shitty.

Never ask a developer to work for free in promise of future equity.

People who are discussing what programming language is best aren't shipping products.

Only learn what you need now.

The danger of building on top of other company's API is any changes to the API will bring your business down.

# Launch

First launch is still good to generate press.

Capture email. Don't say 'subscribe'. Tell what useful things your user will get, .e.g.  'Get weekly PHP jobs.'

Include a feedback box.

Use controversy because most people aren't brave. E.g. GoFuckingDoIt.com.

Make every feature release a launch opportunity.

Launch in Product Hunt, Hacker News, and Reddit.

## Product Hunt

Being on top of Product Hunt gets you 10,000 visitors and 300 simultaneous users.

Many tech journalist are looking for their next story here.

You only have one opportunity to submit in a long time.

Launch at 00:00:01 PST because you get the whole day to vote.

If you're launch a version 2.0, add 2.0 in your title and inform the community manager.

Bad title: "An algorithmic application for machine"
Good title: "The first [emoji] machine learning [emoji] photo editor"

Use animated GIF for thumbnail.

Take high-res screenshot by zooming in your app.

After launching:
- share in your social media but don't ask them to upvote.
- Write a comment about who are you, why you made it and your future plan.

## Hacker News

Gets you 50,000 visitors with 10,000 simultaneous users.

Has a more direct and honest community. Expect more negative comments.

Use the show-and-tell tab.

Bad title: "Petsy.com - The best food delivery for pets"
Good title: "Show HN: I made a site that lets you subscribe to pet food delivery"

After submitting, give it a small boost of upvote.

Don't forward your post to many friends to upvote. Limit to 5 people. Spread out the timing.

If the post doesn't go well, repost another week. Try different title and timing.

## Reddit

Expect 500,000 visitors and 25,000 simultaneous users if you're on the front page.

Make sure your server can handle huge traffic. Use static site.

Good title: 'Hi /r/pets! I made a site that lets you subscribe to food delivery for your pet.'

Submit to:
- /r/<your-niche>
- /r/startups
- /r/internetisbeautiful
- /r/dataisbeautiful

## BetaList

You'll need to pay $129 to go live.

Gets you 1000 visitors.

## Blogging

Tell your story in different media.

## Press

Use press to kickstart traction, but you'll need it lesser when you have traction.

Make sure you control the conversation. You set the angle of the story. Fact check it before they post.

Don't contact their main email address, e.g. tips@news.com.

Make it personal. Figure out who fits your style and niche.

Expect 5% reply rate.

Use **submit.co** to find journalists. Follow up.

Journalists hate if you approach through social media. Use email but keep it real short, e.g:

```
Subject: Food delivery startup for your puppy Debby

Hi Jody! I made a site that lets you subscribe to food deliveryfor your pet. Maybe it'll save you some time feeding Debby.

https://petsy.com
```

Reply them quickly and concisely. Give them what they need. Send screenshots and press material to make their job easy.

# Growth

Don't hire growth hackers. Your product should be viral by itself.

Tell your story as personal as possible. Be transparent because people like to be part of success/failure stories.

Make it easy to share with meta tags. Use URL2PNG to create dynamic screenshots.

Allow replication of site state using URL parameters.

Program dynamic texts based on user interaction.

SimilarWeb is more accurate if your site has more than 100,000 visits monthly. Estimate $1-$10 per 1,000 visits.

# Charging

Don't lower your price and don't make it free.

Entrepreneurs made their best apps when they are pressured to pay bills.

Always add a 'buy button' to validate. You can hook it up to this message: "Sorry, we didn't charge your card but thanks for your interest. Our product isn't done yet, but we'll let you know when it is."

Try 'pay-per-feature' pricing model.

Native ads is better than Google. Always add 'sponsored'.

Look for sponsorship from companies with lots of VC money.

Communities are good business model because they are niche. Add a job board.

Always refund quickly.

Pay $5,000 for a good accountant if you're doing over $50,000 a year. Quiz them on Stripe, tax payments in different countries.

Pay $2500 monthly to customer support and let them have lots of autonomy.

Have developers on standby. They'll get an alert when something isn't working. Pay them $50/hour if they fix it first.

## To pass the bus test:

- Use scripts.
- Hire 2 dev ops to maintain scripts
- Use Uptime Robot to set up alerts for your dev.
- Hire a contractor who have access to your bank account to payout to devs.
- Hire an manager to oversee.
- Prepay subscription so your credit card expiry won't be a factor.

# Exit

Sell only when you're not wanting to sell.

Ignore low ballers.

Set up a 10% breakup fee before starting talks. That way you only share your private information to serious buyers.

Decline calls and communicate by text only.

Wait for informal serious buyers.

Don't open with a price. Or open with a high 10x revenue price.

Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE) puts you on an disadvantage in negotiation. It lowers your valuation. Use general valuation like growth-based multiplication.

Full cash is the best deal. Find ways to not record in a single year of income. Put your company in a holding so you're paying a lower corporate tax.

Minimize vesting period.

Avoid earnouts. You don't want to keep working for a company that's no longer yours.

Ensure the non-compete isn't too wide.

Avoid GPL license. Replace all with more business friendly licenses like MIT, Apache or BSD.

After selling, apply FIRE principal. Take out 4% per year because your diversified portfolio should return 7-10%.

You need to ship 10 to 30 products for 1-3 years before you have anything that works.

Launch early and build with/for your users.
