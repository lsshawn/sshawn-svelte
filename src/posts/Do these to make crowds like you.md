# Do these to make crowds like you
:charisma:

1. Have a good time without worrying to impress others. Be silly. Start games.
2. Tease. Set a playful tone early.
3. Mix compliment in tease.
4. Even if you're talking about something the person is not interested, turn it into something relatable. E.g. "I love playing D&D. I play weekly to make sure our friends hang out together"
5. Talk 10 seconds more from where the conversation stops.
6. Be a likable listener.
7. Agree and add to other's conversation.
