# Reciprocity

The rule of reciprocity is key.

If you can show someone that you've researched them and their business, they will feel indebted to you and will be more likely to reply.

# Sam Parr's 4 step framework

1. Stalk then talk

Bring up their interest when emailing.

Get in touch with them before you want to email.

Add them in LinkedIn and Twitter. Like their posts.

Use same profile picture in all your social profile.

2. Getting their email

- DuckDuckGo: "@company.com" sam parr
- Generate permutations of emails using name and domain. Paste all the emails in Gmail. The email that autofills first name and last name is the correct email.
- Tools to get all social profiles from email: Clearbit, Superhuman

3. AIDA

No one cares about you.

Subject lines need to be catchy:
- Interested?
- Want to come?
- I love pumpkin... about your last tweet
- "I hate salesforce!" -- I have the answer to your tweet
- (no subject)

```
<Attention>

I also hate their ___. I know. But give me 2 seconds. I promise this will be worth it.

<Interest>

I built this cool tool that ____. I know it sounds too good, but it works really well.

<Desire: FOMO>

I know [your problem]. This tool will get it done in [time saving benefit].

So far Company A and B are using it. And I'm interating super quickly.

I think you'll benefit in few ways:
    [3 bullet points]

<Action: 1 action to get an easy yes.>

e.g:
- So what do you think... can we count you in?
- Just say yes and I'll send everything.
- I understand you can't. No worries. But if you can, it's going to make a big difference in your life.

<PS: the most read section>

P.S. [Common interest, make it personal]
```

4. Follow up

- It takes 4 emails to reply.
- Show progress
- Get buy in. I'll build it if you buy.
- Stay in touch
- Small check-ins. Email them on broken links.
- Interact with them on social media.
- Made them smile.
- It's not annoying if you can give value or entertain.

Handle rejection:
- I promise ___. What can I do to make this worth your while?

# Cold emails

1. Only one question. Asking zero question is ok.

An email to thank them for existing is okay.

2. Don't be too succinct.

Have personality and mention something memorable.

3. Tell about you and your credentials.

Have an email signature. Tell where you're from.

4. Switch to voice if mutual

Just ask "Let's talk"

5. Never ask if they'll mentor you

Follow-up. Persistence is being polite. Try different channels.
