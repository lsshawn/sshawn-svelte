### Ideology, not feature

VaynerMedia clients don't choose them based on its feature. They choose VaynerMedia because of it's ideology - Attention is the most valuable currency and social is where to get it.

Feature, benefits and case studies aren't sharable or interesting. If you're selling ideology, you can wax lyrical around it in different ways that'll not bore down your audience.

### No need for client case study

Gary doesn’t need to use any client case studies for VaynerMedia. Market your own use of your product — share your own use of your product.

### SaaS content to create

SaaS companies shouldn't talk about their solution all the time. They should create content that their prospects would find useful.

### Sales is about relationship

Start liking their content, replying, retweeting and trying to provide value.

One day they just might click on your profile and see that you are sales rep, or a VP or biz/dev person at a company. They might just need your services which is when either you or they reach out.

Go in soft, provide value, provide value, and build relationships.
