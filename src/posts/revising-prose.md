It's only 176 pages and I think it's a required read for all office workers. This is about cutting the fats and writing your idea clearly.

# Highlights

> Nobody feels comfortable writing simply "Boy meets Girl."
>
> Our education system required us to write "A romantic relationship is ongoing between Boy and Girl."

## The Paramedic Method

1. Circle the prepositions.
2. Circle the "is" forms.
3. Ask, "Where's the action?" "Who's kicking who?"
4. Put this "kicking" action in a simple (not compound) active verb.
5. Start fast - no slow windups.
6. Write out each sentence on a blank sheet of paper and mark off its basic rhythmic units with a "/" .
7. Read the passage aloud with emphasis and feeling.
8. Mark off sentence lengths in the passage with a "/".

## Where's the action? Who's kicking who?

The bad sentences below have no life. They are diluted by the 'is'.

> Bad: This sentence **is in need of** an active verb.
>
> Good: This sentence **needs** an active verb.

_Lard factor = (words in original sentence - words in new sentence) / words in original sentence_

> Bad: Physical **satisfaction is** the most obvious _of_ the consequences _of_ premarital sex
>
> Good: Premarital sex **satisfies**! Obviously!

Another example:

> Bad: One _of_ the most important results _of_ the presentation _of_ the data is the alteration _of_ the status _of_ the elements _of_ the discourse.
>
> Good: The status of the discourse elements depends on
> how you present the data

## Slow-mo Openings

> The point I wish to make _is that_...
>
> The fact of the matter _is that_...
>
> What surprised me the most _is that_...

Easy fix: CTRL + F to find for the phrase "is that" and delete those openings.

## Examples

1.

> Bad: The most important thing to remember is the fact that interest in the arts has not declined in popularity.
>
> Good: Interest in the arts has not declined.

2.

> Bad: The generation of television is a feeble one, it is a generation lacking in many areas, especially that of artistic background and interest.
>
> Good: The TV generation has shown little interest in art - or in anything else either.

3.

> Bad: Twelve-year-old boys like to fight. Consequently, on several occasions I explained to them the negative aspects of fighting. Other responsibilities included keeping them dry (when near the creek or at times of rain), seeing that they bathed, attending to any minor wounds they acquired, and controlling their mischievous behavior. Another responsibility was remaining patient with the children.
>
> Good: Twelve-year-old boys like to fight. Often, I had to stop them. And I had to keep them out of the rain, and the creek, and
> mischief generally. I had to give out Band-Aids and keep my temper.

"Other responsibilities" sounds like a job description.

In life, you keep them out of the rain. You don't keep them dry.

Read aloud with emphasis and coloration. Vary the sentence length.

Take responsibility and drop phrases like "I think..."

Avoid vague nouns like fixation, function, flexibility, capability, concept and so on.
