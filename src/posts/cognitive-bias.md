# Bias towards certainty

Uber shows car nearby you even before you book to eliminate the uncertainty of waiting.

# Anchoring

Rolls Royce exhibit in yacht because you're staring at expensive stuff all day.

# Time Sunk Cost

Ikea stores are in the outskirt so that the extra effort to get there makes you buy more to make up your trip.
