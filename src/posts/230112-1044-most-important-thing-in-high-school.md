I'll start by telling you something you don't have to know in high school: what you want to do with your life.

Adults ask this mainly as a conversation starter.

If I were back in high school and someone asked about my plans, I'd say that my first priority was to learn what the options were.

I propose instead that you don't commit to anything in the future, but just look at the options available now, and choose those that will give you the most promising range of options afterward.

So I propose that as a replacement for "don't give up on your dreams." **Stay upwind.**

Look for smart people and hard problems.

The best protection is always to be working on hard problems.

Writing novels is hard. Reading novels isn't.

You don't see faces much happier than people winning gold medals. And you know why they're so happy? Relief.

In practice, "stay upwind" reduces to "work on hard problems."

It's that adults take responsibility for themselves. Making a living is only a small part of it.

And when I wasn't working at my day job I'd start trying to do real work.

When I ask people what they regret most about high school, they nearly all say the same thing: that they **wasted so much time.**

Don't just do what they tell you, and don't just refuse to. Instead treat school as a day job.

Now I know a number of people who do great work, and it's the same with all of them. They have little discipline. They're all terrible procrastinators and find it almost impossible to make themselves
do anything they're not interested in.
