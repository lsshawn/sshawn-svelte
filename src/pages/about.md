Hi! I'm Shawn.

# I Code

I love learning new stuff to make stuff, and coding is the tool.

I'm a **full-stack developer** and run a remote web development agency.

My clients hire me because I can help them **launch MVP fast**.

My programming languages: Typescript, Javascript, Vue.js, React.js, Node.js, Python, R, MongoDB, GraphQL, AWS Serverless, Rust.

Right now I'm focused on **AI**.

Would love to contribute to decentralization. [Let's talk.](/contact)

# I'm a Polygot

I speak 5 languages: English, Malay, Korean, Chinese, and Cantonese.

New language put me out of my comfort zone and remind me to be brave at making mistakes.

The reward is I get to open the heart of other people.

# I'm a Quant

Holds a Master degree in Financial Engineering. Had 8 years in commodities trading and quantitative risk management.
