## Cup vs. flask

A cup is good for coffee and a flask for storing water.

I'll throw the cup away.

Plus I can use the flask as a foam roller.

To fit everything into one backpack, I've been thinking a lot about multi-purpose products.

Jojoba oil, for example, replaces my lip balm, hair oil, body lotion, cleanser, hair regrowth serum...

My jackets can be rolled into a pillow if needed.

The only single purpose item that I keep is my analog watch. It helps me focus by reducing the time I check my phone and realized I spent 30 minutes replying messages and scrolling.

## You don't need it

That's the first thing I tell myself before I even decide whether to buy a thing.

I don't need a new phone because the camera is working fine.

I don't need a new shirt for this dinner because it's not torn.

Having this baseline eliminates hours of contemplating.

## Technological choices

It's tempting to be hooked on new features.

I've been on an _'app-diet'_ by reducing everything down to text files.

Google Keep vs Evernote vs Notion? No thanks, I'll just type in plain text files.

Project management apps? I use `todo.txt`.

The benefit of having text file is that this format will still be viewable 10 years later on any device.

And I have full control of the database. I can choose where to store it, how to name it and who to share it.

This applies when choosing a software for a company too.
