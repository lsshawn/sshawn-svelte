I've defaulted to using ChatGPT to search for coding solutions. Google is #2.

Googling for code samples and writing a test case would take minimum 15 minutes. ChatGPT does that in less than a minute.

Sure there are cases where ChatGPT don't know an answer. Or give a corporate-sounding answer without giving me a number.

It sometimes acts like ChadGPT by giving a wrong answer confidently.

But that's ok.

When I can't find an answer in Google search, I won't say "Google is useless".

Instead, I try different search terms until I find an answer.

I bet in the early days, Google have gotten lots of bashing when people were searching "Does AJ loves me?"

It just takes time for everyone to get bored of asking silly questions to ChatGPT.
