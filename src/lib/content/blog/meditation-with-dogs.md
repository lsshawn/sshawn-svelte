Focus on your breathing.

That's how guided meditation starts.

Now comes my puppy.

She rubs my ankle, begging for a belly rub.

You might think that this is a distraction to meditation.

On the contrary, I was able to meditate better holding her on my lap.

My mind wonders away less.

The belly rubbing motion didn't need much attention. It's like monks fiddling their beaded necklace when praying.

## What are you thinking, puppy?

Seeing a dog staring out the window gives me peace.

If you saw me gazing out the window motionless, you would think I have some issues.

_"Are you upset about something?"_

_"Or are you pondering what to eat later?"_

Ask your dog these and you'll hear silence. Chances are her mind is silence too.

Not thinking what time you'll come back.

Not worrying if it'll rain later.

Not angry on you not walking her yesterday.

She's totally present at the moment.

I would believe if someone claims that dogs are Buddha reincarnated.

Except the part where they bark at cats.
