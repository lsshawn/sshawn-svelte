Whenever I hear people giving verbal MTV cribs description of homes, I always wonder..

_Is their toilet plunger black and where is it hidden?_

A house without a toilet plunger isn't wise.

Because shit happens.

My hypothesis on the color is this:

Toilet bowls are white because shit tells you about your health.

But if it doesn't go away after inspection, you better turn off the light and hope your plunger doesn't glow in the dark.

When times are bad, everyone reaches out for the plunger.

_C'est la vie_.
