Whenever I felt the need to read a book, I ask myself "What can I write?"

Reading puts my mind into passive mode. It's spoon feeding my mind.

Writing is creating and it's not easy to start. I had countless times used books to procrastinate writing my next line of code or blog post.

If I want to learn something new because I'm curious - and not for the sake of creating - I'm procrastinating.

There's never enough to learn.

Try to write down the problem you're facing. Write what do you want to know and how you'll apply it to your problem.

Often times you'll come up with your own way of solving the problem - just from the writing down your thoughts.

Read for the purpose of creating. Prioritize producing rather than consuming.
