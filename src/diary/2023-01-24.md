# 💭 Brain dump

I should reread Shape up.

I'm still always fatigue by building a simple app.

Was it because of lack planning and foresight of the intricacy?

Or is it my coding skill? My lack of experience with Svelte?

I was fumbling with stuff like:
- where to put an error message
- what store do I need
- edge cases and multiple paths

Will Shape up help me plan better? And will it guide me on how to handle new ideas/roadblocks when building?
