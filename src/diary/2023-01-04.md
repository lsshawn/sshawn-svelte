Refactor a lot of Securo Customer logic so that I don't need to rush next week.

# 💭 Brain dump

I should reread and practice ShapeUp book again.

When I was working on Zenlighter yesterday, it was a simple product but I was constantly adding new feature and animations as I work through it.

What I predict to take only 3 hours took 8 hours to do.

I should guard my time to make sure I launch fast.
