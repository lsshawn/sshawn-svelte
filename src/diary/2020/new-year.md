# 2020 - A year of focus and creating

## Word of the year

**Focus**

## The year will be...

I'll be excited with what I do. I'll spend 3-6 months in New Zealand working and travelling. Meeting a love there too.

My Cupbots business will start bringing in paying customers. By the end of 2020, I'll have 100 paying customers - a 6 figure business.

With this, I'm all set to travel and live in more places and hire a VA.

## Fear setting

1. Define: Getting back to 9-5 job.
Permanent impact: 1
Prevent: If I can't get paying customers by end of 2020, I'll do freelancing and stay in Malaysia until I have paying customers.
Repair: Work one-off freelance jobs. Work odd jobs like creating websites.
Benefit of attempt: I'll have freedom of time, which I value more than money.

2. Define: Dying without legacy
Permanent impact: 10
Prevent: Build up my chatbot company - doing client work and SaaS.
Repair: There's no turning back. I die and will be forgotten.
