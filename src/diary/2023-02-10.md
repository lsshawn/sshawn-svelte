# 💭 Brain dump

I should get into the habit of starting with this journal.

Not scrolling and ricing for an hour in the morning. That's procrastinating, and that makes me feel shitty.

Focus. Build leverage.

Securo is over and I can start working on my next project. 

Am I building leverage or selling my time?
