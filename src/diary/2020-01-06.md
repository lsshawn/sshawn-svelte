# Day

## I'm grateful for
1. My dogs are still here with me.
2. OnePlus 3T holds up on multiple drops.
3. Working on my gig anytime anyday.

## One thing that'll make today great by noon

Figure out how to test logged in user and public user.

## Daily affirmations

I'm focused on my goal and execution. Owning houses in multiple countries is my dream and I can bring friends and family together.

## Thoughts

Does Uniqlo stop selling winter clothing after Jan?
