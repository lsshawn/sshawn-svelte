:chatgpt:

ChatGPT continues to amaze me.

If your work is on the computer, be it simple googling or engineering work, you need to learn how to ues ChatGPT.

You could get it to draft, learn from mistake, iterate, check errors, and make an elevator pitch for you.

So what is our value now?

What can we do that ChatGPT can't? How can we transcend to a higher level and make use of ChatGPT to do lower level work?

Start by learning to ask good questions.

Learn how to ask broad and then dive deeper into the technicalities.

Being able to answer based on memory has zero value now.

:focus:intention:

Why do I always have the urge to start another task when I haven't complete the task at hand?

Like when I'm writing this, I paused halfway to search for AppSumo deals.

How can I reduce this behavior and focus more?

Perhaps I can have an 'Urge list' notebook so that I write down my current task and urges. And I'm only able to go to the next urge if I complete what I'm doing now.

Browse with intention.

What is your intention now? And do you have an ongoing intention?
