Working at Securo is only for short term. I'm still selling away my time.

Idolize Pieter Levels. Build and launch stuff.

Focus on software only. No physical products.

I need to reach $5k MRR to quit Securo.

Stop reading and start building. Start by training my mental muscle to come out with ideas that people will pay for.

Wake up and give myself 15 minutes to come up with ideas.

Bored? Stop fucking around and write out ideas.
