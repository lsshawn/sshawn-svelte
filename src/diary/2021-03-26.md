## Day

### I'm grateful for

1. Jiun's mom for cooking lovely dishes everyday for me.
2. The slow internet that allows me to not be distracted.
3. Larry's project that I found on Facebook Trends group.

### One thing that'll make today great by noon

Upgrade UI with expanded data - either a JSON or API - and record a video reply to Larry.


### Daily affirmations

I'm a success magnet. I experiment things quickly and am able to build multiple sources of income.
