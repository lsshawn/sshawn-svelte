Plan launch of ReadablePod.

# 🤗 I'm grateful for

Securo for providing a temporary financial support while I work on my side projects.

# 🏄 How could I make today better?
 
I didn't plan the launch, instead I felt the urge to work on Zenlighter.

Was I procrastinating?

I should have stick to my plan and work through the plannning.

# 🏹 The one thing I want to do tomorrow

Fix Securo customer service.

Then finish up Zenlighter with contact and Stripe payment.

# 💭 Brain dump

I'll quit Securo if they want me to go to office.

ReadablePod is for people who prefer to read than listening to podcast.

I wonder how it can be monetized. Charging users may be illegal. Charging the podcaster may have long sales cycle and lower revenue potential.

Zenlighter can be sold for $2.99 per month. I'll need around 7500 users to reach 15,000 MRR.

The good thing is this is a single focused app and there's little maintenance to do.
