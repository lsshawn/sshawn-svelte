# 💭 Brain dump

If you want to code only, then get a job.

That really resonates with me. I feel that what I enjoy most is building new things.

I dread fixing bugs, optimizing code to make it 10% better, and repeated testing.

Build, market, build.

Build a week, market another week (See YongFook tweet).

Or allocate 3 days to build and 2 days to market.
