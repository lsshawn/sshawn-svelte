# 💭 Brain dump

Review Rewarder seems like a product that I could launch to AppSumo lifetime deal.

Businesses that has low review count would want to use this. But after it reaches like 1000 reviews, there's no need to keep using this tool.

Ways I can keep giving value are:
- use AI to create a beautiful visualization of their reviews so that they can display.
- create other tools to incentivize customers
- they have other new businesses that need this tool

Say 1000 reviews is where the need of this app is no longer needed.

If this tool generates 30 reviews a month, they'll need 3 years.

At $12 a month, the LTV is $432 per businesses. 

Should I do a lifetime deal at $99? $59?
