# 💭 Brain dump

If I charge $12 monthly for Review Rewarder, I'm going to need 6944 monthly paying customers.

Seems possible I think.

But I need to get this out to people. Get to people first.

The one hypothesis that needs to be answered is 'Will businesses pay their customers to leave a review'?
