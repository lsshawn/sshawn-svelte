# 💭 Brain dump

What's the monthly cost of living in Chiangmai? How long can I stay in Thailand? If Jiun can take calls via Whatsapp, then we can slowmad in Thailand this year.

Zenlighter should have a no-brainer pricing for early adopters. 

To reach $1mil ARR...
With $1.99 a month, I need 50,000 user
With $3.99 a year, I need 285,000 users

But Zenlighter main purpose isn't to be profitable.

This is my first practice to be a bootstrapper. I want to build the habit of launching. And event if I charge, but I get users email, I can can use that email list to launch my next project.
