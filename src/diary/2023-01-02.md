# 🤗 I'm grateful for

Breakfast with Yanjie and Chun Kit. I'm glad that I have supportive people around me.

# 🏄 How could I make today better?
 
Start the day with a brain dump writing session.

Plan the timeline for 'ReadablePod' project instead of blindly coding and adding feature as I go.

# 🏹 The one thing I want to do tomorrow

Securo USD column for transaction and start working on customer refactoring.

Plan for ReadablePod launch.
