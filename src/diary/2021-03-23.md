## Day

### I'm grateful for
1. Getting to work with Larry with what I built for Shoperware.
2. My travellers notebook. The best investment to unplug and think.
3. Not needing anymore tech from what I currently own.

### One thing that'll make today great by noon

Spend 2 hours to update Coursesify UI.


### Daily affirmations

I'm an idea machine. I can come up with ideas, execute them, and sell more millions.
