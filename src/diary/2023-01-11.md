# 💭 Brain dump

Bakkwa seems to be a seasonal product. I wonder what percentage of their sales happen during CNY?

I would only work on such seasonal businesses if that one event sales:
- can be outsourced
- is equivalent of 90% of my current annual income

I still haven't set up a robust backup system for my workflow. I should.

Gadgets that I'm looking to buy in 2023:
- new pixel fold phone if the price is around 3k
- ANC earbuds that have 50% battery life improvement

Good freelancers are hard to find. Most want money with little work. Here are some red signs to avoid:
- agencies in Upwork. Only hire individuals.
- anyone who ask to be paid to read, research, or meeting time.
- slow response to messages.
- doesn't do first video call.
- doesn't speak good English because it'll be a nightmare down the road.
- doesn't go the extra mile to search for a missing link or plugin.
