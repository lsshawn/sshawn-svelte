Rvius Appsumo prep.

# 🤗 I'm grateful for

Being able to work from home and not go to office.

# 🏄 How could I make today better?

I should be less reactive and set to do what I wanted.

I aimed to work on Rvius, but my feeling drove me to work on Letoro figma.

I shouldn't be that reactive. I need to block out time to accomplish what matters.

# 🏹 The one thing I want to do tomorrow

# 💭 Brain dump

It's already Thursday, and I did 0 marketing for Rvius.

Damn...

I need to track my time. Delegate out to my assistant.

I enjoy building and a bit of marketing strategy. But I need someone to execute for me.
