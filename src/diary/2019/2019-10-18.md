# Day

## I'm grateful for
1. 30s in the new 20s. I'm grateful I'm in this peak period. 
2. Having the time to do what I want and what I focus on.
3. The thought of not desiring to buy anything new.

## 3 things that'll make today great
1. Work on happy path test for @cupbots 
2. Try Botkit 4.0 with multiple controller.
3. Read on what's new with Vuetify. 

## Daily affirmations

I'm a good communicator. I just need to clear my minds and the words will spew out naturally. Be still. Think before speaking. I am an excellent communicator.  

## Thoughts

"Do you know.."

"Have you heard.."

Starting your speech with these sentences can be offensive, especially if you go on and define it without waiting for a reply.

It's downplaying your listener knowledge.

Isn't it better to just say it and let the listeners ask "what is that."
