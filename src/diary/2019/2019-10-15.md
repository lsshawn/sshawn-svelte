# Day

## I'm grateful for
1. My hair is still bushy and black. 
2. Seeing a cat walking on the roof. Wonder how the world looks like without any animals. 
3. The technology I have to create stuff. 

## 3 things that'll make today great
1. Finish happy path test for Cupbots. 
2. Stick to journalling routine. 
3. Eat fruits. 

## Daily affirmations

I'm capable to invent. Turning ideas into reality and building a tribe. There may be many rejections along the way, but those rejections are needed to tell you who you shouldn't spend time focusing on.

## Thoughts

I seem to meditate better with dogs around. They teach me to be more present. I wonder if dogs are really Buddha reincarnation?
