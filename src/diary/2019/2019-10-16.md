# Day

## I'm grateful for
1. Tin Tin is healthy and alive. 
2. My skin is not problematic. 
3. Able to meditate for 10 minutes for 5 days in a row. 

## 3 things that'll make today great
1. Gotta complete the happy path test. I'm delaying it too long. 
2. Replying to Jeremy's email with a plan to tackle the problem. 
3. Weight lift for 10 minutes on biceps and forearm. 

## Daily affirmations

I'm able to execute on my plans. Yet, I'm still and does not waver when people think it's not possible. Control my focus and good things will come.

## Thoughts

Are there any other ways to be out of my comfort zone? Travelling, cold shower, yoga?
