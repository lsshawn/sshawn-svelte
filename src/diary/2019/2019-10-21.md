# Day

## I'm grateful for
1. Sleep. Too much sleep. 
2. A brand new day and saying yes to life 
3. Able to help out my friend. 

## 3 things that'll make today great
1. Get into the flow and feel the traction of working on Cupbots test. 
2. Stand more. 
3. Have a more focused mind, focusing on task #1 

## Daily affirmations

I'm not just a little dust that occupy this current time. I can create a legacy that people 200 years later will see my contribution to mankind.

## Thoughts

We are free to choose what we want to believe. Or join a collective institution to believe a God. No point in arguing who's right because you'll be arguing with billions of people. But God shouldn't be the reason why you do it. It's your choice.
