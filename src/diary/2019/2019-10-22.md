# Day

## I'm grateful for
1. My face that doesn't age quickly. 
2. My ability to stay away from negativity of the society comparing with one another. 
3. Disease free family. Healthy and walking. 

## 3 things that'll make today great
1. Focus on Cupbots task and spend 5 hours on it.
2. Feel the flow of accomplishing a great task. 
3. Typing the 15 sentences in Japanese. 

## Daily affirmations

I'm indistractable. I focus on the task at hand regardless of the outcome. I will succeed if I stay focus and do the work. I don't need affirmations from people to know I'm on the right path.

## Thoughts

Instagram is a place where you go to be jealous and wanting for more.
