# Day

## I'm grateful for
1. Having authentic friends around.
2. Having money in the back so I didn't have to sleep on the street.
3. Having the urge to learn new things - am learning ledger plain text accounting.

## 3 things that'll make today great
1. Streamline personal and business finance
2. Write out my process for streamlining finance.
3. A 10 minutes meditation in the afternoon

## Daily affirmations

I'm a valuable entity and can create differences to people. Making a difference to another people is what matters - not the number of people.

## Thoughts

Every idea, action, process should start by writing. Writing clears your head and help you to concretely put the ideas into actions.
