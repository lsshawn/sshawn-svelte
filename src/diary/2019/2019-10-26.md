# Day

## I'm grateful for
1. Able to sleep well.
2. Having everything I need to invent stuff at home.
3. The roof. Being homeless is a scary proposition.

## 3 things that'll make today great
1. Try not to focus on lifehacks. Focus on getting Cupbots test only.
2. Write more. Publish 1 article.
3. Read during idle time.

## Daily affirmations

I'm a focused individual and my task now is to grow Cupbots. I shall not let other people thoughts and actions distract me from my journey.

## Thoughts

Meditation - you don't need an app. Just do nothing.
