# 💭 Brain dump

Launch early. Launch multiple times.

I need to launch 30 products in this year to see which stick.

Freelancer needs to market themselves. If all you want to code, get a job.

If Bing includes ChatGPT for free, that would be a good switch from Google. I get ChatGPT answer and search results, which is what I'm doing now.
